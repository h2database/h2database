@advanced_1029_h2
Result Sets

@advanced_1030_h3
Statements that Return a Result Set

@advanced_1031_p
 The following statements return a result set: <code>SELECT, EXPLAIN, CALL, SCRIPT, SHOW, HELP</code>. All other statements return an update count. 

@advanced_1032_h3
Limiting the Number of Rows

@advanced_1033_p
 Before the result is returned to the application, all rows are read by the database. Server side cursors are not supported currently. If only the first few rows are interesting for the application, then the result set size should be limited to improve the performance. This can be done using <code>LIMIT</code> in a query (example: <code>SELECT * FROM TEST LIMIT 100</code>), or by using <code>Statement.setMaxRows(max)</code>. 

@advanced_1034_h3
Large Result Sets and External Sorting

@advanced_1035_p
 For large result set, the result is buffered to disk. The threshold can be defined using the statement <code>SET MAX_MEMORY_ROWS</code>. If <code>ORDER BY</code> is used, the sorting is done using an external sort algorithm. In this case, each block of rows is sorted using quick sort, then written to disk; when reading the data, the blocks are merged together. 

@advanced_1036_h2
Large Objects

@advanced_1037_h3
Storing and Reading Large Objects

@advanced_1038_p
 If it is possible that the objects don't fit into memory, then the data type CLOB (for textual data) or BLOB (for binary data) should be used. For these data types, the objects are not fully read into memory, by using streams. To store a BLOB, use <code>PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream</code>. To store a CLOB, use <code>PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream</code>. To read a BLOB, use <code>ResultSet.getBinaryStream</code>, and to read a CLOB, use <code>ResultSet.getCharacterStream</code>. When using the client/server mode, large BLOB and CLOB data is stored in a temporary file on the client side. 

@advanced_1039_h3
When to use CLOB/BLOB

@advanced_1040_p
 This database stores large LOB (CLOB and BLOB) objects as separate files. Small LOB objects are stored in-place, the threshold can be set using <a href="grammar.html#set_max_length_inplace_lob" class="notranslate" >MAX_LENGTH_INPLACE_LOB</a>, but there is still an overhead to use CLOB/BLOB. Because of this, BLOB and CLOB should never be used for columns with a maximum size below about 200 bytes. The best threshold depends on the use case; reading in-place objects is faster than reading from separate files, but slows down the performance of operations that don't involve this column. 

@advanced_1041_h3
Large Object Compression

@advanced_1042_p
 CLOB and BLOB values can be compressed by using <a href="grammar.html#set_compress_lob" class="notranslate" >SET COMPRESS_LOB</a>. The LZF algorithm is faster but needs more disk space. By default compression is disabled, which usually speeds up write operations. If you store many large compressible values such as XML, HTML, text, and uncompressed binary files, then compressing can save a lot of disk space (sometimes more than 50%), and read operations may even be faster. 

@advanced_1043_h2
Linked Tables

@advanced_1044_p
 This database supports linked tables, which means tables that don't exist in the current database but are just links to another database. To create such a link, use the <code>CREATE LINKED TABLE</code> statement: 

@advanced_1045_p
 You can then access the table in the usual way. Whenever the linked table is accessed, the database issues specific queries over JDBC. Using the example above, if you issue the query <code>SELECT * FROM LINK WHERE ID=1</code>, then the following query is run against the PostgreSQL database: <code>SELECT * FROM TEST WHERE ID=?</code>. The same happens for insert and update statements. Only simple statements are executed against the target database, that means no joins. Prepared statements are used where possible. 

@advanced_1046_p
 To view the statements that are executed against the target table, set the trace level to 3. 

@advanced_1047_p
 If multiple linked tables point to the same database (using the same database URL), the connection is shared. To disable this, set the system property <code>h2.shareLinkedConnections=false</code>. 

@advanced_1048_p
 The statement <a href="grammar.html#create_linked_table" class="notranslate" >CREATE LINKED TABLE</a> supports an optional schema name parameter. 

@advanced_1049_h2
Transaction Isolation

@advanced_1050_p
 Transaction isolation is provided for all data manipulation language (DML) statements. Most data definition language (DDL) statements commit the current transaction. See the <a href="grammar.html">Grammar</a> for details. 

@advanced_1051_p
 This database supports the following transaction isolation levels: 

@advanced_1052_b
Read Committed

@advanced_1053_li
 This is the default level. Read locks are released immediately. Higher concurrency is possible when using this level.

@advanced_1054_li
 To enable, execute the SQL statement <code>SET LOCK_MODE 3</code>

@advanced_1055_li
 or append <code>;LOCK_MODE=3</code> to the database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;LOCK_MODE=3</code> 

@advanced_1056_b
Serializable

@advanced_1057_li
 To enable, execute the SQL statement <code>SET LOCK_MODE 1</code>

@advanced_1058_li
 or append <code>;LOCK_MODE=1</code> to the database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;LOCK_MODE=1</code> 

@advanced_1059_b
Read Uncommitted

@advanced_1060_li
 This level means that transaction isolation is disabled.

@advanced_1061_li
 To enable, execute the SQL statement <code>SET LOCK_MODE 0</code>

@advanced_1062_li
 or append <code>;LOCK_MODE=0</code> to the database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;LOCK_MODE=0</code> 

@advanced_1063_p
 When using the isolation level 'serializable', dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads are prohibited. 

@advanced_1064_b
Dirty Reads

@advanced_1065_li
 Means a connection can read uncommitted changes made by another connection.

@advanced_1066_li
 Possible with: read uncommitted 

@advanced_1067_b
Non-Repeatable Reads

@advanced_1068_li
 A connection reads a row, another connection changes a row and commits, and the first connection re-reads the same row and gets the new result.

@advanced_1069_li
 Possible with: read uncommitted, read committed 

@advanced_1070_b
Phantom Reads

@advanced_1071_li
 A connection reads a set of rows using a condition, another connection inserts a row that falls in this condition and commits, then the first connection re-reads using the same condition and gets the new row.

@advanced_1072_li
 Possible with: read uncommitted, read committed 

@advanced_1073_h3
Table Level Locking

@advanced_1074_p
 The database allows multiple concurrent connections to the same database. To make sure all connections only see consistent data, table level locking is used by default. This mechanism does not allow high concurrency, but is very fast. Shared locks and exclusive locks are supported. Before reading from a table, the database tries to add a shared lock to the table (this is only possible if there is no exclusive lock on the object by another connection). If the shared lock is added successfully, the table can be read. It is allowed that other connections also have a shared lock on the same object. If a connection wants to write to a table (update or delete a row), an exclusive lock is required. To get the exclusive lock, other connection must not have any locks on the object. After the connection commits, all locks are released. This database keeps all locks in memory. 

@advanced_1075_h3
Lock Timeout

@advanced_1076_p
 If a connection cannot get a lock on an object, the connection waits for some amount of time (the lock timeout). During this time, hopefully the connection holding the lock commits and it is then possible to get the lock. If this is not possible because the other connection does not release the lock for some time, the unsuccessful connection will get a lock timeout exception. The lock timeout can be set individually for each connection. 

@advanced_1077_h2
Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

@advanced_1078_p
 The MVCC feature allows higher concurrency than using (table level or row level) locks. When using MVCC in this database, delete, insert and update operations will only issue a shared lock on the table. An exclusive lock is still used when adding or removing columns, when dropping the table, and when using <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>. Connections only 'see' committed data, and own changes. That means, if connection A updates a row but doesn't commit this change yet, connection B will see the old value. Only when the change is committed, the new value is visible by other connections (read committed). If multiple connections concurrently try to update the same row, the database waits until it can apply the change, but at most until the lock timeout expires. 

@advanced_1079_p
 To use the MVCC feature, append <code>;MVCC=TRUE</code> to the database URL: 

@advanced_1080_p
 MVCC is disabled by default. The MVCC feature is not fully tested yet. The limitations of the MVCC mode are: it can not be used at the same time as <code>MULTI_THREADED=TRUE</code>; the complete undo log must fit in memory when using multi-version concurrency (the setting <code>MAX_MEMORY_UNDO</code> has no effect). It is not possible to enable or disable this setting while the database is already open. The setting must be specified in the first connection (the one that opens the database). 

@advanced_1081_h2
Clustering / High Availability

@advanced_1082_p
 This database supports a simple clustering / high availability mechanism. The architecture is: two database servers run on two different computers, and on both computers is a copy of the same database. If both servers run, each database operation is executed on both computers. If one server fails (power, hardware or network failure), the other server can still continue to work. From this point on, the operations will be executed only on one server until the other server is back up. 

@advanced_1083_p
 Clustering can only be used in the server mode (the embedded mode does not support clustering). The cluster can be re-created using the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool without stopping the remaining server. Applications that are still connected are automatically disconnected, however when appending <code>;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE</code>, they will recover from that. 

@advanced_1084_p
 To initialize the cluster, use the following steps: 

@advanced_1085_li
Create a database 

@advanced_1086_li
Use the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool to copy the database to another location and initialize the clustering. Afterwards, you have two databases containing the same data. 

@advanced_1087_li
Start two servers (one for each copy of the database) 

@advanced_1088_li
You are now ready to connect to the databases with the client application(s) 

@advanced_1089_h3
Using the CreateCluster Tool

@advanced_1090_p
 To understand how clustering works, please try out the following example. In this example, the two databases reside on the same computer, but usually, the databases will be on different servers. 

@advanced_1091_li
Create two directories: <code>server1, server2</code>. Each directory will simulate a directory on a computer. 

@advanced_1092_li
Start a TCP server pointing to the first directory. You can do this using the command line: 

@advanced_1093_li
Start a second TCP server pointing to the second directory. This will simulate a server running on a second (redundant) computer. You can do this using the command line: 

@advanced_1094_li
Use the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool to initialize clustering. This will automatically create a new, empty database if it does not exist. Run the tool on the command line: 

@advanced_1095_li
You can now connect to the databases using an application or the H2 Console using the JDBC URL <code>jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9101,localhost:9102/~/test</code> 

@advanced_1096_li
If you stop a server (by killing the process), you will notice that the other machine continues to work, and therefore the database is still accessible. 

@advanced_1097_li
To restore the cluster, you first need to delete the database that failed, then restart the server that was stopped, and re-run the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool. 

@advanced_1098_h3
Detect Which Cluster Instances are Running

@advanced_1099_p
 To find out which cluster nodes are currently running, execute the following SQL statement: 

@advanced_1100_p
 If the result is <code>''</code> (two single quotes), then the cluster mode is disabled. Otherwise, the list of servers is returned, enclosed in single quote. Example: <code>'server1:9191,server2:9191'</code>. 

@advanced_1101_h3
Clustering Algorithm and Limitations

@advanced_1102_p
 Read-only queries are only executed against the first cluster node, but all other statements are executed against all nodes. There is currently no load balancing made to avoid problems with transactions. The following functions may yield different results on different cluster nodes and must be executed with care: <code>RANDOM_UUID(), SECURE_RAND(), SESSION_ID(), MEMORY_FREE(), MEMORY_USED(), CSVREAD(), CSVWRITE(), RAND()</code> [when not using a seed]. Those functions should not be used directly in modifying statements (for example <code>INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE</code>). However, they can be used in read-only statements and the result can then be used for modifying statements. 

@advanced_1103_p
 When using the cluster modes, result sets are read fully in memory by the client, so that there is no problem if the server dies that executed the query. Result sets must fit in memory on the client side. 

@advanced_1104_h2
Two Phase Commit

@advanced_1105_p
 The two phase commit protocol is supported. 2-phase-commit works as follows: 

@advanced_1106_li
Autocommit needs to be switched off 

@advanced_1107_li
A transaction is started, for example by inserting a row 

@advanced_1108_li
The transaction is marked 'prepared' by executing the SQL statement <code>PREPARE COMMIT transactionName</code> 

@advanced_1109_li
The transaction can now be committed or rolled back 

@advanced_1110_li
If a problem occurs before the transaction was successfully committed or rolled back (for example because a network problem occurred), the transaction is in the state 'in-doubt' 

@advanced_1111_li
When re-connecting to the database, the in-doubt transactions can be listed with <code>SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.IN_DOUBT</code> 

@advanced_1112_li
Each transaction in this list must now be committed or rolled back by executing <code>COMMIT TRANSACTION transactionName</code> or <code>ROLLBACK TRANSACTION transactionName</code> 

@advanced_1113_li
The database needs to be closed and re-opened to apply the changes 

@advanced_1114_h2
Compatibility

@advanced_1115_p
 This database is (up to a certain point) compatible to other databases such as HSQLDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL. There are certain areas where H2 is incompatible. 

@advanced_1116_h3
Transaction Commit when Autocommit is On

@advanced_1117_p
 At this time, this database engine commits a transaction (if autocommit is switched on) just before returning the result. For a query, this means the transaction is committed even before the application scans through the result set, and before the result set is closed. Other database engines may commit the transaction in this case when the result set is closed. 

@advanced_1118_h3
Keywords / Reserved Words

@advanced_1119_p
 There is a list of keywords that can't be used as identifiers (table names, column names and so on), unless they are quoted (surrounded with double quotes). The list is currently: 

@advanced_1120_code
 CROSS, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DISTINCT, EXCEPT, EXISTS, FALSE, FOR, FROM, FULL, GROUP, HAVING, INNER, INTERSECT, IS, JOIN, LIKE, LIMIT, MINUS, NATURAL, NOT, NULL, ON, ORDER, PRIMARY, ROWNUM, SELECT, SYSDATE, SYSTIME, SYSTIMESTAMP, TODAY, TRUE, UNION, UNIQUE, WHERE 

@advanced_1121_p
 Certain words of this list are keywords because they are functions that can be used without '()' for compatibility, for example <code>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code>. 

@advanced_1122_h2
Standards Compliance

@advanced_1123_p
 This database tries to be as much standard compliant as possible. For the SQL language, ANSI/ISO is the main standard. There are several versions that refer to the release date: SQL-92, SQL:1999, and SQL:2003. Unfortunately, the standard documentation is not freely available. Another problem is that important features are not standardized. Whenever this is the case, this database tries to be compatible to other databases. 

@advanced_1124_h2
Run as Windows Service

@advanced_1125_p
 Using a native wrapper / adapter, Java applications can be run as a Windows Service. There are various tools available to do that. The Java Service Wrapper from <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org">Tanuki Software, Inc.</a> is included in the installation. Batch files are provided to install, start, stop and uninstall the H2 Database Engine Service. This service contains the TCP Server and the H2 Console web application. The batch files are located in the directory <code>h2/service</code>. 

@advanced_1126_h3
Install the Service

@advanced_1127_p
 The service needs to be registered as a Windows Service first. To do that, double click on <code>1_install_service.bat</code>. If successful, a command prompt window will pop up and disappear immediately. If not, a message will appear. 

@advanced_1128_h3
Start the Service

@advanced_1129_p
 You can start the H2 Database Engine Service using the service manager of Windows, or by double clicking on <code>2_start_service.bat</code>. Please note that the batch file does not print an error message if the service is not installed. 

@advanced_1130_h3
Connect to the H2 Console

@advanced_1131_p
 After installing and starting the service, you can connect to the H2 Console application using a browser. Double clicking on <code>3_start_browser.bat</code> to do that. The default port (8082) is hard coded in the batch file. 

@advanced_1132_h3
Stop the Service

@advanced_1133_p
 To stop the service, double click on <code>4_stop_service.bat</code>. Please note that the batch file does not print an error message if the service is not installed or started. 

@advanced_1134_h3
Uninstall the Service

@advanced_1135_p
 To uninstall the service, double click on <code>5_uninstall_service.bat</code>. If successful, a command prompt window will pop up and disappear immediately. If not, a message will appear. 

@advanced_1136_h2
ODBC Driver

@advanced_1137_p
 This database does not come with its own ODBC driver at this time, but it supports the PostgreSQL network protocol. Therefore, the PostgreSQL ODBC driver can be used. Support for the PostgreSQL network protocol is quite new and should be viewed as experimental. It should not be used for production applications. 

@advanced_1138_p
 To use the PostgreSQL ODBC driver on 64 bit versions of Windows, first run <code>c:/windows/syswow64/odbcad32.exe</code>. At this point you set up your DSN just like you would on any other system. See also: <a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-odbc/2005-09/msg00125.php">Re: ODBC Driver on Windows 64 bit</a> 

@advanced_1139_h3
ODBC Installation

@advanced_1140_p
 First, the ODBC driver must be installed. Any recent PostgreSQL ODBC driver should work, however version 8.2 (<code>psqlodbc-08_02*</code>) or newer is recommended. The Windows version of the PostgreSQL ODBC driver is available at <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi">http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi</a>. 

@advanced_1141_h3
Starting the Server

@advanced_1142_p
 After installing the ODBC driver, start the H2 Server using the command line: 

@advanced_1143_p
 The PG Server (PG for PostgreSQL protocol) is started as well. By default, databases are stored in the current working directory where the server is started. Use <code>-baseDir</code> to save databases in another directory, for example the user home directory: 

@advanced_1144_p
 The PG server can be started and stopped from within a Java application as follows: 

@advanced_1145_p
 By default, only connections from localhost are allowed. To allow remote connections, use <code>-pgAllowOthers</code> when starting the server. 

@advanced_1146_h3
ODBC Configuration

@advanced_1147_p
 After installing the driver, a new Data Source must be added. In Windows, run <code>odbcad32.exe</code> to open the Data Source Administrator. Then click on 'Add...' and select the PostgreSQL Unicode driver. Then click 'Finish'. You will be able to change the connection properties:

@advanced_1179_h3
PG Protocol Support Limitations

@advanced_1180_p
 At this time, only a subset of the PostgreSQL network protocol is implemented. Also, there may be compatibility problems on the SQL level, with the catalog, or with text encoding. Problems are fixed as they are found. Currently, statements can not be canceled when using the PG protocol. 

@advanced_1181_p
 PostgreSQL ODBC Driver Setup requires a database password; that means it is not possible to connect to H2 databases without password. This is a limitation of the ODBC driver. 

@advanced_1182_h3
Security Considerations

@advanced_1183_p
 Currently, the PG Server does not support challenge response or encrypt passwords. This may be a problem if an attacker can listen to the data transferred between the ODBC driver and the server, because the password is readable to the attacker. Also, it is currently not possible to use encrypted SSL connections. Therefore the ODBC driver should not be used where security is important. 

@advanced_1184_h2
Using H2 in Microsoft .NET

@advanced_1185_p
 The database can be used from Microsoft .NET even without using Java, by using IKVM.NET. You can access a H2 database on .NET using the JDBC API, or using the ADO.NET interface. 

@advanced_1186_h3
Using the ADO.NET API on .NET

@advanced_1187_p
 An implementation of the ADO.NET interface is available in the open source project <a href="http://code.google.com/p/h2sharp">H2Sharp</a>. 

@advanced_1188_h3
Using the JDBC API on .NET

@advanced_1189_li
Install the .NET Framework from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. Mono has not yet been tested. 

@advanced_1190_li
Install <a href="http://www.ikvm.net">IKVM.NET</a>. 

@advanced_1191_li
Copy the <code>h2*.jar</code> file to <code>ikvm/bin</code> 

@advanced_1192_li
Run the H2 Console using: <code>ikvm -jar h2*.jar</code> 

@advanced_1193_li
Convert the H2 Console to an <code>.exe</code> file using: <code>ikvmc -target:winexe h2*.jar</code>. You may ignore the warnings. 

@advanced_1194_li
Create a <code>.dll</code> file using (change the version accordingly): <code>ikvmc.exe -target:library -version:1.0.69.0 h2*.jar</code> 

@advanced_1195_p
 If you want your C# application use H2, you need to add the <code>h2.dll</code> and the <code>IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary.dll</code> to your C# solution. Here some sample code: 

@advanced_1196_h2
ACID

@advanced_1197_p
 In the database world, ACID stands for: 

@advanced_1198_li
Atomicity: transactions must be atomic, meaning either all tasks are performed or none. 

@advanced_1199_li
Consistency: all operations must comply with the defined constraints. 

@advanced_1200_li
Isolation: transactions must be isolated from each other. 

@advanced_1201_li
Durability: committed transaction will not be lost. 

@advanced_1202_h3
Atomicity

@advanced_1203_p
 Transactions in this database are always atomic. 

@advanced_1204_h3
Consistency

@advanced_1205_p
 By default, this database is always in a consistent state. Referential integrity rules are enforced except when explicitly disabled. 

@advanced_1206_h3
Isolation

@advanced_1207_p
 For H2, as with most other database systems, the default isolation level is 'read committed'. This provides better performance, but also means that transactions are not completely isolated. H2 supports the transaction isolation levels 'serializable', 'read committed', and 'read uncommitted'. 

@advanced_1208_h3
Durability

@advanced_1209_p
 This database does not guarantee that all committed transactions survive a power failure. Tests show that all databases sometimes lose transactions on power failure (for details, see below). Where losing transactions is not acceptable, a laptop or UPS (uninterruptible power supply) should be used. If durability is required for all possible cases of hardware failure, clustering should be used, such as the H2 clustering mode. 

@advanced_1210_h2
Durability Problems

@advanced_1211_p
 Complete durability means all committed transaction survive a power failure. Some databases claim they can guarantee durability, but such claims are wrong. A durability test was run against H2, HSQLDB, PostgreSQL, and Derby. All of those databases sometimes lose committed transactions. The test is included in the H2 download, see <code>org.h2.test.poweroff.Test</code>. 

@advanced_1212_h3
Ways to (Not) Achieve Durability

@advanced_1213_p
 Making sure that committed transactions are not lost is more complicated than it seems first. To guarantee complete durability, a database must ensure that the log record is on the hard drive before the commit call returns. To do that, databases use different methods. One is to use the 'synchronous write' file access mode. In Java, <code>RandomAccessFile</code> supports the modes <code>rws</code> and <code>rwd</code>: 

@advanced_1214_code
rwd

@advanced_1215_li
: every update to the file's content is written synchronously to the underlying storage device. 

@advanced_1216_code
rws

@advanced_1217_li
: in addition to <code>rwd</code>, every update to the metadata is written synchronously.

@advanced_1218_p
 A test (<code>org.h2.test.poweroff.TestWrite</code>) with one of those modes achieves around 50 thousand write operations per second. Even when the operating system write buffer is disabled, the write rate is around 50 thousand operations per second. This feature does not force changes to disk because it does not flush all buffers. The test updates the same byte in the file again and again. If the hard drive was able to write at this rate, then the disk would need to make at least 50 thousand revolutions per second, or 3 million RPM (revolutions per minute). There are no such hard drives. The hard drive used for the test is about 7200 RPM, or about 120 revolutions per second. There is an overhead, so the maximum write rate must be lower than that. 

@advanced_1219_p
 Calling <code>fsync</code> flushes the buffers. There are two ways to do that in Java: 

@advanced_1220_code
FileDescriptor.sync()

@advanced_1221_li
. The documentation says that this forces all system buffers to synchronize with the underlying device. This method is supposed to return after all in-memory modified copies of buffers associated with this file descriptor have been written to the physical medium. 

@advanced_1222_code
FileChannel.force()

@advanced_1223_li
 (since JDK 1.4). This method is supposed to force any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage device that contains it. 

@advanced_1224_p
 By default, MySQL calls <code>fsync</code> for each commit. When using one of those methods, only around 60 write operations per second can be achieved, which is consistent with the RPM rate of the hard drive used. Unfortunately, even when calling <code>FileDescriptor.sync()</code> or <code>FileChannel.force()</code>, data is not always persisted to the hard drive, because most hard drives do not obey <code>fsync()</code>: see <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/13/0529252">Your Hard Drive Lies to You</a>. In Mac OS X, <code>fsync</code> does not flush hard drive buffers. See <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg00072.html">Bad fsync?</a>. So the situation is confusing, and tests prove there is a problem. 

@advanced_1225_p
 Trying to flush hard drive buffers is hard, and if you do the performance is very bad. First you need to make sure that the hard drive actually flushes all buffers. Tests show that this can not be done in a reliable way. Then the maximum number of transactions is around 60 per second. Because of those reasons, the default behavior of H2 is to delay writing committed transactions. 

@advanced_1226_p
 In H2, after a power failure, a bit more than one second of committed transactions may be lost. To change the behavior, use <code>SET WRITE_DELAY</code> and <code>CHECKPOINT SYNC</code>. Most other databases support commit delay as well. In the performance comparison, commit delay was used for all databases that support it. 

@advanced_1227_h3
Running the Durability Test

@advanced_1228_p
 To test the durability / non-durability of this and other databases, you can use the test application in the package <code>org.h2.test.poweroff</code>. Two computers with network connection are required to run this test. One computer just listens, while the test application is run (and power is cut) on the other computer. The computer with the listener application opens a TCP/IP port and listens for an incoming connection. The second computer first connects to the listener, and then created the databases and starts inserting records. The connection is set to 'autocommit', which means after each inserted record a commit is performed automatically. Afterwards, the test computer notifies the listener that this record was inserted successfully. The listener computer displays the last inserted record number every 10 seconds. Now, switch off the power manually, then restart the computer, and run the application again. You will find out that in most cases, none of the databases contains all the records that the listener computer knows about. For details, please consult the source code of the listener and test application. 

@advanced_1229_h2
Using the Recover Tool

@advanced_1230_p
 The <code>Recover</code> tool can be used to extract the contents of a database file, even if the database is corrupted. It also extracts the content of the transaction log and large objects (CLOB or BLOB). To run the tool, type on the command line: 

@advanced_1231_p
 For each database in the current directory, a text file will be created. This file contains raw insert statements (for the data) and data definition (DDL) statements to recreate the schema of the database. This file can be executed using the <code>RunScript</code> tool or a <code>RUNSCRIPT FROM</code> SQL statement. The script includes at least one <code>CREATE USER</code> statement. If you run the script against a database that was created with the same user, or if there are conflicting users, running the script will fail. Consider running the script against a database that was created with a user name that is not in the script. 

@advanced_1232_p
 The <code>Recover</code> tool creates a SQL script from database file. It also processes the transaction log. 

@advanced_1233_h2
File Locking Protocols

@advanced_1234_p
 Multiple concurrent connections to the same database are supported, however a database file can only be open for reading and writing (in embedded mode) by one process at the same time. Otherwise, the processes would overwrite each others data and corrupt the database file. To protect against this problem, whenever a database is opened, a lock file is created to signal other processes that the database is in use. If the database is closed, or if the process that opened the database stops normally, this lock file is deleted. 

@advanced_1235_p
 In special cases (if the process did not terminate normally, for example because there was a power failure), the lock file is not deleted by the process that created it. That means the existence of the lock file is not a safe protocol for file locking. However, this software uses a challenge-response protocol to protect the database files. There are two methods (algorithms) implemented to provide both security (that is, the same database files cannot be opened by two processes at the same time) and simplicity (that is, the lock file does not need to be deleted manually by the user). The two methods are 'file method' and 'socket methods'. 

@advanced_1236_p
 The file locking protocols have the following limitation: if a shared file system is used, and the machine with the lock owner is sent to sleep (standby or hibernate), another machine may take over. If the machine that originally held the lock wakes up, the database may become corrupt. If this situation can occur, the application must ensure the database is closed when the application is put to sleep. 

@advanced_1237_h3
File Locking Method 'File'

@advanced_1238_p
 The default method for database file locking is the 'File Method'. The algorithm is: 

@advanced_1239_li
If the lock file does not exist, it is created (using the atomic operation <code>File.createNewFile</code>). Then, the process waits a little bit (20 ms) and checks the file again. If the file was changed during this time, the operation is aborted. This protects against a race condition when one process deletes the lock file just after another one create it, and a third process creates the file again. It does not occur if there are only two writers. 

@advanced_1240_li
 If the file can be created, a random number is inserted together with the locking method ('file'). Afterwards, a watchdog thread is started that checks regularly (every second once by default) if the file was deleted or modified by another (challenger) thread / process. Whenever that occurs, the file is overwritten with the old data. The watchdog thread runs with high priority so that a change to the lock file does not get through undetected even if the system is very busy. However, the watchdog thread does use very little resources (CPU time), because it waits most of the time. Also, the watchdog only reads from the hard disk and does not write to it. 

@advanced_1241_li
 If the lock file exists and was recently modified, the process waits for some time (up to two seconds). If it was still changed, an exception is thrown (database is locked). This is done to eliminate race conditions with many concurrent writers. Afterwards, the file is overwritten with a new version (challenge). After that, the thread waits for 2 seconds. If there is a watchdog thread protecting the file, he will overwrite the change and this process will fail to lock the database. However, if there is no watchdog thread, the lock file will still be as written by this thread. In this case, the file is deleted and atomically created again. The watchdog thread is started in this case and the file is locked. 

@advanced_1242_p
 This algorithm is tested with over 100 concurrent threads. In some cases, when there are many concurrent threads trying to lock the database, they block each other (meaning the file cannot be locked by any of them) for some time. However, the file never gets locked by two threads at the same time. However using that many concurrent threads / processes is not the common use case. Generally, an application should throw an error to the user if it cannot open a database, and not try again in a (fast) loop. 

@advanced_1243_h3
File Locking Method 'Socket'

@advanced_1244_p
 There is a second locking mechanism implemented, but disabled by default. To use it, append <code>;FILE_LOCK=SOCKET</code> to the database URL. The algorithm is: 

@advanced_1245_li
If the lock file does not exist, it is created. Then a server socket is opened on a defined port, and kept open. The port and IP address of the process that opened the database is written into the lock file. 

@advanced_1246_li
If the lock file exists, and the lock method is 'file', then the software switches to the 'file' method. 

@advanced_1247_li
If the lock file exists, and the lock method is 'socket', then the process checks if the port is in use. If the original process is still running, the port is in use and this process throws an exception (database is in use). If the original process died (for example due to a power failure, or abnormal termination of the virtual machine), then the port was released. The new process deletes the lock file and starts again. 

@advanced_1248_p
 This method does not require a watchdog thread actively polling (reading) the same file every second. The problem with this method is, if the file is stored on a network share, two processes (running on different computers) could still open the same database files, if they do not have a direct TCP/IP connection. 

@advanced_1249_h2
File Locking Method 'Serialized'

@advanced_1250_p
 This locking mode allows to open multiple connections to the same database. The connections may be opened from multiple processes and from different computers. When writing to the database, access is automatically synchronized internally. Write operations are slower than when using the server mode, and concurrency is relatively poor. The advantage of this mode is that there is no need to start a server. 

@advanced_1251_p
 To enable this feature, append <code>;FILE_LOCK=SERIALIZED</code> to the database URL. 

@advanced_1252_p
 This feature is relatively new. When using it for production, please ensure your use case is well tested (if possible with automated test cases). 

@advanced_1253_h2
Protection against SQL Injection

@advanced_1254_h3
What is SQL Injection

@advanced_1255_p
 This database engine provides a solution for the security vulnerability known as 'SQL Injection'. Here is a short description of what SQL injection means. Some applications build SQL statements with embedded user input such as: 

@advanced_1256_p
 If this mechanism is used anywhere in the application, and user input is not correctly filtered or encoded, it is possible for a user to inject SQL functionality or statements by using specially built input such as (in this example) this password: <code>' OR ''='</code>. In this case the statement becomes: 

@advanced_1257_p
 Which is always true no matter what the password stored in the database is. For more information about SQL Injection, see <a href="#glossary_links">Glossary and Links</a>. 

@advanced_1258_h3
Disabling Literals

@advanced_1259_p
 SQL Injection is not possible if user input is not directly embedded in SQL statements. A simple solution for the problem above is to use a prepared statement: 

@advanced_1260_p
 This database provides a way to enforce usage of parameters when passing user input to the database. This is done by disabling embedded literals in SQL statements. To do this, execute the statement: 

@advanced_1261_p
 Afterwards, SQL statements with text and number literals are not allowed any more. That means, SQL statement of the form <code>WHERE NAME='abc'</code> or <code>WHERE CustomerId=10</code> will fail. It is still possible to use prepared statements and parameters as described above. Also, it is still possible to generate SQL statements dynamically, and use the Statement API, as long as the SQL statements do not include literals. There is also a second mode where number literals are allowed: <code>SET ALLOW_LITERALS NUMBERS</code>. To allow all literals, execute <code>SET ALLOW_LITERALS ALL</code> (this is the default setting). Literals can only be enabled or disabled by an administrator. 

@advanced_1262_h3
Using Constants

@advanced_1263_p
 Disabling literals also means disabling hard-coded 'constant' literals. This database supports defining constants using the <code>CREATE CONSTANT</code> command. Constants can be defined only when literals are enabled, but used even when literals are disabled. To avoid name clashes with column names, constants can be defined in other schemas: 

@advanced_1264_p
 Even when literals are enabled, it is better to use constants instead of hard-coded number or text literals in queries or views. With constants, typos are found at compile time, the source code is easier to understand and change. 

@advanced_1265_h3
Using the ZERO() Function

@advanced_1266_p
 It is not required to create a constant for the number 0 as there is already a built-in function <code>ZERO()</code>: 

@advanced_1267_h2
Protection against Remote Access

@advanced_1268_p
 By default this database does not allow connections from other machines when starting the H2 Console, the TCP server, or the PG server. Remote access can be enabled using the command line options <code>-webAllowOthers, -tcpAllowOthers, -pgAllowOthers</code>. If you enable remote access, please also consider using the options <code>-baseDir, -ifExists</code>, so that remote users can not create new databases or access existing databases with weak passwords. When using the option <code>-baseDir</code>, only databases within that directory may be accessed. Ensure the existing accessible databases are protected using strong passwords. 

@advanced_1269_h2
Restricting Class Loading and Usage

@advanced_1270_p
 By default there is no restriction on loading classes and executing Java code for admins. That means an admin may call system functions such as <code>System.setProperty</code> by executing: 

@advanced_1271_p
 To restrict users (including admins) from loading classes and executing code, the list of allowed classes can be set in the system property <code>h2.allowedClasses</code> in the form of a comma separated list of classes or patterns (items ending with <code>*</code>). By default all classes are allowed. Example: 

@advanced_1272_p
 This mechanism is used for all user classes, including database event listeners, trigger classes, user-defined functions, user-defined aggregate functions, and JDBC driver classes (with the exception of the H2 driver) when using the H2 Console. 

@advanced_1273_h2
Security Protocols

@advanced_1274_p
 The following paragraphs document the security protocols used in this database. These descriptions are very technical and only intended for security experts that already know the underlying security primitives. 

@advanced_1275_h3
User Password Encryption

@advanced_1276_p
 When a user tries to connect to a database, the combination of user name, @, and password are hashed using SHA-256, and this hash value is transmitted to the database. This step does not protect against an attacker that re-uses the value if he is able to listen to the (unencrypted) transmission between the client and the server. But, the passwords are never transmitted as plain text, even when using an unencrypted connection between client and server. That means if a user reuses the same password for different things, this password is still protected up to some point. See also 'RFC 2617 - HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication' for more information. 

@advanced_1277_p
 When a new database or user is created, a new random salt value is generated. The size of the salt is 64 bits. Using the random salt reduces the risk of an attacker pre-calculating hash values for many different (commonly used) passwords. 

@advanced_1278_p
 The combination of user-password hash value (see above) and salt is hashed using SHA-256. The resulting value is stored in the database. When a user tries to connect to the database, the database combines user-password hash value with the stored salt value and calculates the hash value. Other products use multiple iterations (hash the hash value again and again), but this is not done in this product to reduce the risk of denial of service attacks (where the attacker tries to connect with bogus passwords, and the server spends a lot of time calculating the hash value for each password). The reasoning is: if the attacker has access to the hashed passwords, he also has access to the data in plain text, and therefore does not need the password any more. If the data is protected by storing it on another computer and only accessible remotely, then the iteration count is not required at all. 

@advanced_1279_h3
File Encryption

@advanced_1280_p
 The database files can be encrypted using two different algorithms: AES-128 and XTEA (using 32 rounds). The reasons for supporting XTEA is performance (XTEA is about twice as fast as AES) and to have an alternative algorithm if AES is suddenly broken. 

@advanced_1281_p
 When a user tries to connect to an encrypted database, the combination of <code>file@</code> and the file password is hashed using SHA-256. This hash value is transmitted to the server. 

@advanced_1282_p
 When a new database file is created, a new cryptographically secure random salt value is generated. The size of the salt is 64 bits. The combination of the file password hash and the salt value is hashed 1024 times using SHA-256. The reason for the iteration is to make it harder for an attacker to calculate hash values for common passwords. 

@advanced_1283_p
 The resulting hash value is used as the key for the block cipher algorithm (AES-128 or XTEA with 32 rounds). Then, an initialization vector (IV) key is calculated by hashing the key again using SHA-256. This is to make sure the IV is unknown to the attacker. The reason for using a secret IV is to protect against watermark attacks. 

@advanced_1284_p
 Before saving a block of data (each block is 8 bytes long), the following operations are executed: first, the IV is calculated by encrypting the block number with the IV key (using the same block cipher algorithm). This IV is combined with the plain text using XOR. The resulting data is encrypted using the AES-128 or XTEA algorithm. 

@advanced_1285_p
 When decrypting, the operation is done in reverse. First, the block is decrypted using the key, and then the IV is calculated combined with the decrypted text using XOR. 

@advanced_1286_p
 Therefore, the block cipher mode of operation is CBC (cipher-block chaining), but each chain is only one block long. The advantage over the ECB (electronic codebook) mode is that patterns in the data are not revealed, and the advantage over multi block CBC is that flipped cipher text bits are not propagated to flipped plaintext bits in the next block. 

@advanced_1287_p
 Database encryption is meant for securing the database while it is not in use (stolen laptop and so on). It is not meant for cases where the attacker has access to files while the database is in use. When he has write access, he can for example replace pieces of files with pieces of older versions and manipulate data like this. 

@advanced_1288_p
 File encryption slows down the performance of the database engine. Compared to unencrypted mode, database operations take about 2.2 times longer when using XTEA, and 2.5 times longer using AES (embedded mode). 

@advanced_1289_h3
Wrong Password / User Name Delay

@advanced_1290_p
 To protect against remote brute force password attacks, the delay after each unsuccessful login gets double as long. Use the system properties <code>h2.delayWrongPasswordMin</code> and <code>h2.delayWrongPasswordMax</code> to change the minimum (the default is 250 milliseconds) or maximum delay (the default is 4000 milliseconds, or 4 seconds). The delay only applies for those using the wrong password. Normally there is no delay for a user that knows the correct password, with one exception: after using the wrong password, there is a delay of up to (randomly distributed) the same delay as for a wrong password. This is to protect against parallel brute force attacks, so that an attacker needs to wait for the whole delay. Delays are synchronized. This is also required to protect against parallel attacks. 

@advanced_1291_p
 There is only one exception message for both wrong user and for wrong password, to make it harder to get the list of user names. It is not possible from the stack trace to see if the user name was wrong or the password. 

@advanced_1292_h3
HTTPS Connections

@advanced_1293_p
 The web server supports HTTP and HTTPS connections using <code>SSLServerSocket</code>. There is a default self-certified certificate to support an easy starting point, but custom certificates are supported as well. 

@advanced_1294_h2
SSL/TLS Connections

@advanced_1295_p
 Remote SSL/TLS connections are supported using the Java Secure Socket Extension (<code>SSLServerSocket, SSLSocket</code>). By default, anonymous SSL is enabled. The default cipher suite is <code>SSL_DH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_MD5</code>. 

@advanced_1296_p
 To use your own keystore, set the system properties <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> and <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword</code> before starting the H2 server and client. See also <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CustomizingStores"> Customizing the Default Key and Trust Stores, Store Types, and Store Passwords</a> for more information. 

@advanced_1297_p
 To disable anonymous SSL, set the system property <code>h2.enableAnonymousSSL</code> to false. 

@advanced_1298_h2
Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID)

@advanced_1299_p
 This database supports UUIDs. Also supported is a function to create new UUIDs using a cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator. With random UUIDs, the chance of two having the same value can be calculated using the probability theory. See also 'Birthday Paradox'. Standardized randomly generated UUIDs have 122 random bits. 4 bits are used for the version (Randomly generated UUID), and 2 bits for the variant (Leach-Salz). This database supports generating such UUIDs using the built-in function <code>RANDOM_UUID()</code>. Here is a small program to estimate the probability of having two identical UUIDs after generating a number of values: 

@advanced_1300_p
 Some values are: 

@advanced_1301_th
Number of UUIs

@advanced_1302_th
Probability of Duplicates

@advanced_1303_td
2^36=68'719'476'736

@advanced_1304_td
0.000'000'000'000'000'4

@advanced_1305_td
2^41=2'199'023'255'552

@advanced_1306_td
0.000'000'000'000'4

@advanced_1307_td
2^46=70'368'744'177'664

@advanced_1308_td
0.000'000'000'4

@advanced_1309_p
 To help non-mathematicians understand what those numbers mean, here a comparison: one's annual risk of being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion, that means the probability is about 0.000'000'000'06. 

@advanced_1310_h2
Settings Read from System Properties

@advanced_1311_p
 Some settings of the database can be set on the command line using <code>-DpropertyName=value</code>. It is usually not required to change those settings manually. The settings are case sensitive. Example: 

@advanced_1312_p
 The current value of the settings can be read in the table <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS</code>. 

@advanced_1313_p
 For a complete list of settings, see <a href="../javadoc/org/h2/constant/SysProperties.html">SysProperties</a>. 

@advanced_1314_h2
Setting the Server Bind Address

@advanced_1315_p
 Usually server sockets accept connections on any/all local addresses. This may be a problem on multi-homed hosts. To bind only to one address, use the system property <code>h2.bindAddress</code>. This setting is used for both regular server sockets and for SSL server sockets. IPv4 and IPv6 address formats are supported. 

@advanced_1316_h2
Pluggable File System

@advanced_1317_p
 This database supports a pluggable file system API. The file system implementation is selected using a file name prefix. The following file systems are included: 

@advanced_1318_code
zip:

@advanced_1319_li
 read-only zip-file based file system. Format: <code>zip:/zipFileName!/fileName</code>. 

@advanced_1320_code
nio:

@advanced_1321_li
 file system that uses <code>FileChannel</code> instead of <code>RandomAccessFile</code> (faster in some operating systems). 

@advanced_1322_code
nioMapped:

@advanced_1323_li
 file system that uses memory mapped files (faster in some operating systems). 

@advanced_1324_code
split:

@advanced_1325_li
 file system that splits files in 1 GB files (stackable with other file systems). 

@advanced_1326_code
memFS:

@advanced_1327_li
 in-memory file system (slower than mem; experimental; mainly used for testing the database engine itself). 

@advanced_1328_code
memLZF:

@advanced_1329_li
 compressing in-memory file system (slower than memFS but uses less memory; experimental; mainly used for testing the database engine itself). 

@advanced_1330_p
 As an example, to use the the <code>nio</code> file system, use the following database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:nio:~/test</code>. 

@advanced_1331_p
 To register a new file system, extend the classes <code>org.h2.store.fs.FileSystem, FileObject</code>, and call the method <code>FileSystem.register</code> before using it. 

@advanced_1332_h2
Limits and Limitations

@advanced_1333_p
 This database has the following known limitations: 

@advanced_1334_li
Database file size limits (excluding BLOB and CLOB data): With the default storage mechanism, the maximum file size is currently 256 GB for the data, and 256 GB for the index. With the page store (experimental): 4 TB or higher. 

@advanced_1335_li
BLOB and CLOB size limit: every CLOB or BLOB can be up to 256 GB. 

@advanced_1336_li
The maximum file size for FAT or FAT32 file systems is 4 GB. That means when using FAT or FAT32, the limit is 4 GB for the data. This is the limitation of the file system. The database does provide a workaround for this problem, it is to use the file name prefix <code>split:</code>. In that case files are split into files of 1 GB by default. An example database URL is: <code>jdbc:h2:split:~/test</code>. 

@advanced_1337_li
The maximum number of rows per table is 2'147'483'648. 

@advanced_1338_li
Main memory requirements: The larger the database, the more main memory is required. With the default storage mechanism, the minimum main memory required for a 12 GB database is around 240 MB. With the page store (experimental), the minimum main memory required is much lower, around 1 MB for each 8 GB database file size. 

@advanced_1339_li
Limit on the complexity of SQL statements. Statements of the following form will result in a stack overflow exception: 

@advanced_1340_li
There is no limit for the following entities, except the memory and storage capacity: maximum identifier length (table name, column name, and so on); maximum number of tables, columns, indexes, triggers, and other database objects; maximum statement length, number of parameters per statement, tables per statement, expressions in order by, group by, having, and so on; maximum rows per query; maximum columns per table, columns per index, indexes per table, lob columns per table, and so on; maximum row length, index row length, select row length; maximum length of a varchar column, decimal column, literal in a statement. 

@advanced_1341_li
For limitations on data types, see the documentation of the respective Java data type or the data type documentation of this database.

Portability

@build_1012_p
 This database is written in Java and therefore works on many platforms. It can also be compiled to a native executable using GCJ. 

@build_1013_p
 For Java 1.4, the jar file needs to be converted first using <a href="http://retrotranslator.sourceforge.net">Retrotranslator</a>. 

@build_1014_h2
Environment

@build_1015_p
 To run this database, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.5 or higher is required. 

@build_1016_p
 To create the database executables, the following software stack was used. To use this database, it is not required to install this software however. 

@build_1017_li

Building the Software

@build_1028_p
 You need to install a JDK, for example the Sun JDK version 1.5 or 1.6. Ensure that Java binary directory is included in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, and that the environment variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> points to your Java installation. On the command line, go to the directory <code>h2</code> and execute the following command: 

@build_1029_p
 For Linux and OS X, use <code>./build.sh</code> instead of <code>build</code>. 

@build_1030_p
 You will get a list of targets. If you want to build the <code>jar</code> file, execute (Windows): 

@build_1031_h3
Switching the Source Code

@build_1032_p
 By default the source code uses Java 1.5 features, however Java 1.6 is supported as well. To switch the source code to the installed version of Java, run: 

@build_1033_h2
Build Targets

@build_1034_p
 The build system can generate smaller jar files as well. The following targets are currently supported: 

@build_1035_code
jarClient

@build_1036_li
 creates the file <code>h2client.jar</code>. This only contains the JDBC client. 

@build_1037_code
jarSmall

@build_1038_li
 creates the file <code>h2small.jar</code>. This only contains the embedded database. Debug information is disabled. 

@build_1039_code
jarJaqu

@build_1040_li
 creates the file <code>h2jaqu.jar</code>. This only contains the JaQu (Java Query) implementation. All other jar files do not include JaQu. 

@build_1041_code
javadocImpl

@build_1042_li
 creates the Javadocs of the implementation. 

@build_1043_p
 To create the file <code>h2client.jar</code>, go to the directory <code>h2</code> and execute the following command: 

@build_1044_h2
Using Maven 2

@build_1045_h3
Using a Central Repository

@build_1046_p
 You can include the database in your Maven 2 project as a dependency. Example: 

@build_1047_p
 New versions of this database are first uploaded to http://hsql.sourceforge.net/m2-repo/ and then automatically synchronized with the main Maven repository; however after a new release it may take a few hours before they are available there. 

@build_1048_h3
Using Snapshot Version

@build_1049_p
 To build a <code>h2-*-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> file and upload it the to the local Maven 2 repository, execute the following command: 

@build_1050_p
 Afterwards, you can include the database in your Maven 2 project as a dependency: 

@build_1051_h2
Translating

@build_1052_p
 The translation of this software is split into the following parts: 

@build_1053_li
H2 Console: <code>src/main/org/h2/server/web/res/_text_*.prop</code> 

@build_1054_li
Error messages: <code>src/main/org/h2/res/_messages_*.prop</code> 

@build_1055_p
 To translate the H2 Console, start it and select Preferences / Translate. After you are done, send the translated <code>*.prop</code> file to the Google Group. The web site is currently translated using Google. 

@build_1056_h2
Providing Patches

@build_1057_p
 If you like to provide patches, please consider the following guidelines to simplify merging them: 

@build_1058_li
Only use Java 1.5 features (do not use Java 1.6) (see <a href="#environment">Environment</a>). 

@build_1059_li
Follow the coding style used in the project, and use Checkstyle (see above) to verify. For example, do not use tabs (use spaces instead). The checkstyle configuration is in <code>src/installer/checkstyle.xml</code>. 

@build_1060_li
A template of the Eclipse settings are in <code>src/installer/eclipse.settings/*</code>. If you want to use them, you need to copy them to the <code>.settings</code> directory. The formatting options (<code>eclipseCodeStyle</code>) are also included. 

@build_1061_li
Please provide test cases and integrate them into the test suite. For Java level tests, see <code>src/test/org/h2/test/TestAll.java</code>. For SQL level tests, see <code>src/test/org/h2/test/test.in.txt</code> or <code>testSimple.in.txt</code>. 

@build_1062_li
The test cases should cover at least 90% of the changed and new code; use a code coverage tool to verify that (see above). or use the build target <code>coverage</code>. 

@build_1063_li
Verify that you did not break other features: run the test cases by executing <code>build test</code>. 

@build_1064_li
Provide end user documentation if required (<code>src/docsrc/html/*</code>). 

@build_1065_li
Document grammar changes in <code>src/docsrc/help/help.csv</code> 

@build_1066_li
Provide a change log entry (<code>src/docsrc/html/changelog.html</code>). 

@build_1067_li
Verify the spelling using <code>build spellcheck</code>. If required add the new words to <code>src/tools/org/h2/build/doc/dictionary.txt</code>. 

@build_1068_li
Run <code>src/installer/buildRelease</code> to find and fix formatting errors. 

@build_1069_li
Verify the formatting using <code>build docs</code> and <code>build javadoc</code>. 

@build_1070_li
Submit patches as <code>.patch</code> files (compressed if big). To create a patch using Eclipse, use Team / Create Patch. 

@build_1071_p
 For legal reasons, patches need to be public in the form of an email to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/h2-database">group</a>, or in the form of an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/h2database/issues/list">issue report or attachment</a>. Significant contributions need to include the following statement: 

@build_1072_p
 "I wrote the code, it's mine, and I'm contributing it to H2 for distribution multiple-licensed under the H2 License, version 1.0, and under the Eclipse Public License, version 1.0 (http://h2database.com/html/license.html)." 

@build_1073_h2
Reporting Problems or Requests

@build_1074_p
 Please consider the following checklist if you have a question, want to report a problem, or if you have a feature request: 

@build_1075_li
Feature requests are always welcome, even if the feature is already on the <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>. Your mail will help prioritize feature requests. If you urgently need a feature, consider <a href="#providing_patches">providing a patch</a>. 

@build_1076_li
Before posting problems, check the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> and do a <a href="http://google.com">Google search</a>. 

@build_1077_li
When got an unexpected exception, please try the <a href="sourceError.html">Error Analyzer tool</a>. If this doesn't help, please report the problem, including the complete error message and stack trace, and the root cause stack trace(s). 

@build_1078_li
When sending source code, please use a public web clipboard such as <a href="http://pastebin.com">Pastebin</a>, <a href="http://cl1p.net">Cl1p</a>, or <a href="http://www.mysticpaste.com/new">Mystic Paste</a> to avoid formatting problems. Please keep test cases as simple and short as possible, but so that the problem can still be reproduced. As a template, use: <a href="http://h2database.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/h2/src/test/org/h2/samples/HelloWorld.java">HelloWorld.java</a>. Method that simply call other methods should be avoided, as well as unnecessary exception handling. Please use the JDBC API and no external tools or libraries. The test should include all required initialization code, and should be started with the main method. 

@build_1079_li
For large attachments, use a public temporary storage such as <a href="http://rapidshare.com">Rapidshare</a>. 

@build_1080_li
Google Group versus issue tracking: Use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/h2-database">Google Group</a> for questions or if you are not sure it's a bug. If you are sure it's a bug, you can create an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/h2database/issues/list">issue</a>, but you don't need to (sending an email to the group is enough). Please note that only few people monitor the issue tracking system. 

@build_1081_li
For out-of-memory problems, please analyze the problem yourself first, for example using the command line option <code>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</code> and a memory analysis tool such as the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat">Eclipse Memory Analyzer (MAT)</a>. 

@build_1082_li
It may take a few days to get an answers. Please do not double post. 

@build_1083_h2

Generating Railroad Diagrams

@build_1091_p
 The railroad diagrams are HTML, formatted as nested tables. The diagrams are generated as follows: 

@build_1092_li
The BNF parser (<code>org.h2.bnf.Bnf</code>) reads and parses the BNF from the file <code>help.csv</code>. 

@build_1093_li
The page parser (<code>org.h2.server.web.PageParser</code>) reads the template HTML file and fills in the diagrams. 

@build_1094_li
The rail images (one straight, four junctions, two turns) are generated using a simple Java application. 

@build_1095_p
 To generate railroad diagrams for other grammars, see the package <code>org.h2.jcr</code>. This package is used to generate the SQL-2 railroad diagrams for the JCR 2.0 specification.

Change Log

@changelog_1001_h2
Next Version (unreleased)

@changelog_1002_li
Build tool: ability to only run one test using the -Dtest=className setting. 

@changelog_1003_li
Experimental feature to support case sensitive catalog names and database names using the DATABASE() method. To use this feature, set the system property h2.databaseToUpper to false. The plan is to set the property to false by default in version 1.3.x. Issue 204 - thanks to Sylvain Cuaz (ILM Informatique) for the patch. 

@changelog_1004_li
Experimental feature to support nested joins. To enable, set the system property h2.nestedJoins to true. If enabled, nested joins and right outer joins should work as expected (issues 145, 177, and 203). The plan is to enable this feature by default in version 1.3.x. 

@changelog_1005_li
New sample application: CachedPreparedStatements. 

@changelog_1006_li
When creating functions within a schema, those functions could not be used in views, nested queries, and constraints. Fixed. 

@changelog_1007_li
The benchmarks have been run using recent database versions. 

@changelog_1008_li
Version 1.2.137 could still not be converted to Java 1.4 (because the Retrotranslator doesn't support BigDecimal.precision). 

@changelog_1009_li
Cluster: non-admin users could not connect when one of the cluster node was stopped. Issue 206. 

@changelog_1010_h2
Version 1.2.137 (2010-06-06)

@changelog_1011_li
Statements with a nested query and a condition that was always NULL threw an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Example: select * from (select null as x) where x=1 

@changelog_1012_li
Experimental feature to support very large transactions (except when using MVCC). To enable, set the system property h2.largeTransactions to true. If enabled, changes to tables without a primary key can be buffered to disk. The plan is to enable this feature by default in version 1.3.x. 

@changelog_1013_li
H2 Console: editing result sets is now also working for database other than H2, if they do support updatable result sets. Add "@edit" before the query. Only limited testing has been done on this feature, some data types may not work (please provide feedback if you find issues). 

@changelog_1014_li
Cluster: an open transaction was committed when a cluster node was stopped (because disabling the cluster executes SET CLUSTER '', which committed the transaction). Transaction are no longer committed when calling SET CLUSTER. Issue 199. 

@changelog_1015_li
Cluster: non-admin users couldn't connect to the cluster and couldn't disable the cluster. Issue 201. 

@changelog_1016_li
Cluster: NEXTVAL('sequence') was only called on one cluster node, therefore sequence values could get out of sync. 

@changelog_1017_li
Version 1.2.136 could not be converted to Java 1.4 (because the Retrotranslator doesn't support BigDecimal.precision). A workaround has been implemented. 

@changelog_1018_li
The error code of IO exceptions in CSV functions was incorrect. 

@changelog_1019_li
The TriggerPassData example now uses a prefix (the database name). 

@changelog_1020_li
The wrong exception was thrown when trying to reference a table that doesn't support references such as a table in the information schema. 

@changelog_1021_li
Server.shutdownTcpServer can now stop all TCP servers on this JVM. 

@changelog_1022_li
JdbcConnectionPool: the default connection timeout is now 30 seconds (it used to be 5 minutes). 

@changelog_1023_li
LOB storage: LOBs added with "h2.lobInDatabase" enabled couldn't be read later with this option disabled. 

@changelog_1024_h2
Version 1.2.136 (2010-05-24)

@changelog_1025_li
When using ORDER BY and there are both ascending and descending indexes, the database used the first index even when the second one could be used for sorting. 

@changelog_1026_li
Conditions of the form columnName IS NULL now use an index. To disable this feature, set the system property h2.optimizeIsNull to false. 

@changelog_1027_li
H2 Console: when the settings were not stored yet (for example when running for the first time), the last recently used settings were not stored. A workaround was to create the file ".h2.server.properties" manually in the current user home directory, with the contents: webAllowOthers=false, webPort=8082, webSSL=false, 0=Generic H2 (Embedded)|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\:h2\:~/test|sa (where a comma is a newline). 

@changelog_1028_li
The source code is now switched to Java 6 (JDK 1.6) by default. Java 5 (JDK 1.5) is still supported, and the jar file is still compiled for Java 5. 

@changelog_1029_li
The BOM (the byte-order-mark) character 0xfeff at the beginning of the file is ignored. This is for compatibility with Microsoft Excel. 

@changelog_1030_li
When opening an existing database, the cache size is set to at most half the amount of memory available for the virtual machine (Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()), even if the cache size setting stored in the database is larger. Setting the cache size in the database URL or explicitly using SET CACHE_SIZE overrides this value (even if larger than the physical memory). 

@changelog_1031_li
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS: the cache size is now returned in KB. 

@changelog_1032_li
New system property h2.selectForUpdateMvcc, the default is false (the feature is disabled). When enabled, SELECT ... FOR UPDATE only locks the selected rows in the MVCC mode. Aggregate or GROUP BY queries are not allowed in this case. 

@changelog_1033_li
Profiler: improved message if there was no stack trace. 

@changelog_1034_li
The H2 Console can now be used within another application, in a frame or iframe. Issue 197. 

@changelog_1035_li
Recover tool: the statistics section now includes page type counts again. 

@changelog_1036_li
Queries with multiple IN(...) conditions sometimes return the wrong results when there was a multi-column index for the column. 

@changelog_1037_li
Queries with IN(..., NULL) did sometimes return the wrong results when there was a index for the column. 

@changelog_1038_li
DECIMAL: faster precision and memory usage calculations. 

@changelog_1039_li
A new class org.h2.tools.TriggerAdapter allows to use the ResultSet interface within trigger implementations. 

@changelog_1040_li
A subselect which used an index could lead to wrong results. Fixed. 

@changelog_1041_li
Creating a cached temporary non persistent table with a primary key threw a NullPointerException. 

@changelog_1042_h2
Version 1.2.135 (2010-05-08)

@changelog_1043_li
Temporary files were not deleted when using large transactions, disabling autocommit, and closing the session without committing. 

@changelog_1044_li
Queries using multiple IN(..) conditions on the same table could cause repeated rows in the result set. 

@changelog_1045_li
Translation: Lubomir Grajciar translated the H2 Console as well as all error message to Slovensky. Thanks a lot! 

@changelog_1046_li
There was a possible Java level deadlock when opening an uninitialized database and using a file system that also opened a database. 

@changelog_1047_li
When killing the process while the database was writing a checkpoint, while it was closing, or while running recovery (while removing temporary tables from a previous run), the database could become corrupt. A new test case has been implemented to ensure such problems can not occur in the future. 

@changelog_1048_li
File system: new method FileSystem.setReadOnly. 

@changelog_1049_li
The page size for new databases can now be set in the database URL using ;PAGE_SIZE=512. Currently this feature is only used to simplify testing. 

@changelog_1050_li
New system property h2.functionsInSchema (default is false). If enabled, the SCRIPT statement always includes the schema name in the CREATE ALIAS statement (even if the schema is PUBLIC). This is not backward compatible with H2 versions 1.2.134 and older. 

@changelog_1051_li
Functions: it is no longer required to add a space after a comma in the parameter list. Example: CREATE ALIAS PARSE_INT FOR "java.lang.Integer.parseInt(java.lang.String,int)" 

@changelog_1052_li
Functions now reside within a schema, similar to sequences. If you do create such functions in schemas other than PUBLIC, then the database can not be opened with older versions of H2. 

@changelog_1053_li
Cluster: after a cluster node failed, the second cluster node can now be re-created and started without having to stop the first cluster node, and without having to stop running applications. To do that, append ;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE to the database URL. 

@changelog_1054_li
Auto-reconnect: if another connection uses the database in exclusive mode then this connection will try to re-connect until the exclusive mode ends. This is important when using the cluster mode. 

@changelog_1055_li
SET EXCLUSIVE now supports 0 (disable), 1 (enable), and 2 (enable and close all other connections). 

@changelog_1056_li
Installing the H2 as a service should now work on Windows 7. The batch files now explicitly set the directory using pushd "%~dp0". 

@changelog_1057_li
Temporary tables can now be 'cached', that means indexes of temporary tables can be persisted. This enables very large temporary tables (both local and global). 

@changelog_1058_li
The CreateCluster tool now sets the source database in exclusive mode before copying data to the new database. 

@changelog_1059_li
The H2 Console now stream results one statement / result set at a time (using chunked transfer encoding). To disable, set the system property h2.consoleStream to false. This feature is not supported when using a servlet container. 

@changelog_1060_li
The H2 Console did not call the CreateCluster tool with the correctly escaped parameters. 

@changelog_1061_li
Improved PostgreSQL compatibility for ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN. 

@changelog_1062_li
Commas at the end of INSERT ... VALUES (), (), are now supported. 

@changelog_1063_li
The H2 Console "Start Browser" button now works even when the IP address changes while the tool runs (for example, because a wireless connection breaks, or when enabling / disabling the network connection). 

@changelog_1064_li
When casting from float or double to BigDecimal, the result was sometimes unexpected, because "new BigDecimal(double val)" was used. Now "BigDecimal.valueOf(double val)" and "new BigDecimal(Float.toString(f))" are used. But it is still not recommended to use float or double for currency values (see data type documentation). 

@changelog_1065_li
Global temporary tables are now deleted when closing the database. Before, they were deleted when opening the database the next time. 

@changelog_1066_li
UNIQUE was not listed as a keyword. 

@changelog_1067_li
Improved error message when an non-SQL-exception occurred in a user defined function. The method name and parameters are included in the error message. 

@changelog_1068_li
For some queries, the exception did not include the SQL statement. Example: select x from system_range(1, 2) group by 'a'. 

@changelog_1069_li
The Shell tool will execute SQL statements passed as using the command line parameter -sql. 

@changelog_1070_li
If InetAddress.getLocalHost() fails, the database should now throw an exception. 

@changelog_1071_li
New columns INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES.INDEX_CLASS and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES.TABLE_CLASS. 

@changelog_1072_li
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES.SQL now contains the CREATE INDEX statement instead of just the fully qualified index name. 

@changelog_1073_h2
Version 1.2.134 (2010-04-23)

@changelog_1074_li
New system property h2.analyzeAuto (default 0 meaning disabled) to automatically run ANALYZE after that many changes to a table. For details, see the Javadoc of this system property. The plan is to set this property to 2000 in version 1.3.x. 

@changelog_1075_li
JdbcXAConnection.start() does not support TMJOIN. Issue 189. 

@changelog_1076_li
MySQL compatibility: TIMESTAMPDIFF is now an alias for DATEDIFF. 

@changelog_1077_li
MERGE did not respect foreign key and check constraints. 

@changelog_1078_li
ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN: changing the data type of a column no longer makes it nullable. 

@changelog_1079_li
When using AUTO_SERVER=TRUE, the server is now started as a daemon thread. This was a problem when using Tomcat and a connection pool. 

@changelog_1080_li
Servers can now be started as a daemon thread using the command line options -tcpDaemon, -pgDaemon, and -webDaemon. 

@changelog_1081_li
H2 Console: the built-in commands are now documented. 

@changelog_1082_li
REPLACE: if any parameter is null, the result is null. 

@changelog_1083_li
Queries with DISTINCT and ORDER BY will now use the index on ORDER BY if possible. This is specially important for queries used inside IN(SELECT ...). 

@changelog_1084_li
The new statement EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes the statement, and displays the query plan with the actual row scan count for each table. 

@changelog_1085_li
H2 Console: the auto-complete feature didn't quote column names that need quoting. Issue 186. 

@changelog_1086_li
The experimental LOB storage mechanism now supports all features of the old one. To use it, set the system property "h2.lobInDatabase" to "true". If you have used this feature in version 1.2.133, you need to export and re-import the database using SCRIPT / RUNSCRIPT. 

@changelog_1087_li
The functions isBeforeFirst() and isAfterLast() were not compliant to the JDBC spec. If the ResultSet contains no rows, they must return false. Fixed. 

@changelog_1088_li
Filesystem parameters like "split:" didn't work in server mode with baseDir set. 

@changelog_1089_li
If baseDir is set, and a database name is given which points to a directory outside the baseDir (eg. "../dbname"), an exception is thrown. 

@changelog_1090_h2
Version 1.2.133 (2010-04-10)

@changelog_1091_li
A new experimental LOB storage mechanism is available. When enabled, CLOB and BLOB data is stored in hidden tables in the database. To use it, set the system property "h2.lobInDatabase" to "true". Compression is not yet implemented. Duplicate objects are only stored once. Usually writing is slower, but reading is faster (mainly because of caching). 

@changelog_1092_li
The Shell tool threw a NumberFormatException on a empty statement. 

@changelog_1093_li
The h2small-*.jar did not support "drop all objects delete files". Now it is supported (the DeleteDbFiles tool is now included). 

@changelog_1094_li
Operations that don't fit in memory are now faster. Temporary file handling was changed. 

@changelog_1095_li
The default maximum log stream size is now 2 MB. This is a good value according to some performance tests. 

@changelog_1096_li
New system property "h2.syncMethod" to configure what method to call when closing the database, on checkpoint, and on CHECKPOINT SYNC. The default is "sync" which calls RandomAccessFile.getFD().sync(). 

@changelog_1097_li
ROWNUM could not be used for pagination. The follow query returned no rows: select x from (select *, rownum as r from system_range(1, 3)) where r=2; 

@changelog_1098_li
Workaround for a java.sql.Date issue: years above 9999 are not formatted correctly. When calling ResultSet.getString() on a date value, an alternative formatting algorithm is used. 

@changelog_1099_li
Prepared statements with nested subqueries did not always return the correct result. Example: select ?, ?, (select count(*) from test t, (select id from test where 0=?) t2 where t2.id=t.id) from test 

@changelog_1100_li
When using MULTI_THREADED=TRUE, the exception following exception could be thrown: "object already exists: TABLES" 

@changelog_1101_li
Comparison of integer columns against float numbers was not always correct. Issue 182. 

@changelog_1102_li
H2 Console: Editing the result of a multi-line queries failed. Issue 183. 

@changelog_1103_li
H2 Console: if the settings file (.h2.properties) can't be accessed, the exception is now ignored. 

@changelog_1104_h2
Version 1.2.132 (2010-03-21)

@changelog_1105_li
The implementation of a Java to C (source code level) converter has been started. The plan is: it should be possible to convert H2 (or a part of it) to C so that the database can be run without a JVM. This will be a long term project (it may take a year or so). 

@changelog_1106_li
User defined table implementation can now be used using CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE. Thanks to Sergi Vladykin for implementing this feature! 

@changelog_1107_li
Improved MS SQL Server compatibility: support string concatenation using "+". Thanks to Stepan for the patch! 

@changelog_1108_li
When using the multi-threaded mode, running ANALYZE concurrently in multiple connections could throw an exception. 

@changelog_1109_li
The MERGE statement is now about 30% faster when using a PreparedStatement. 

@changelog_1110_li
Multi-column indexes where the second or later column was descending did not always produce correct results (rows were missing in the result set, or the result set was empty). 

@changelog_1111_li
When using large transactions or a small log size, the database could get very slow (profiling shows the hotspot is in FileObjectDisk.sync()). 

@changelog_1112_li
The Shell tool now prints the stack trace when the list mode is enabled. 

@changelog_1113_li
CREATE ALIAS ... AS: Compilation was incorrect if the source code contained characters that are not supported by the default file encoding. 

@changelog_1114_li
Issue 176: the JdbcDataSource now also supports a 'description' property. 

@changelog_1115_li
The Shell tool threw a ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException after 20 statements. 

@changelog_1116_li
When using the small version of H2 ('jarClient'), the first call to Connection.createBlob (or similar) could throw a ClassNotFoundException because the file org.h2.store.fs.FileSystemZip is not included. This missing class is now ignored. 

@changelog_1117_li
Literals of type BIGINT now have the correct data type. 

@changelog_1118_h2
Version 1.2.131 (2010-03-05)

@changelog_1119_li
Older versions of H2 (version 1.2.127 and older) could not connect to a new version (version 1.2.129 and newer). The connection blocked when trying to connect. Now the connection no longer blocks, instead a SQL exception is thrown. 

@changelog_1120_li
In versions 1.2.129 and 1.2.130, a database could not be opened sometimes after dropping tables or indexes, and then creating new indexes for existing tables. The exception contained the text "parent not found" (version 1.2.129) or "Table not found" (version 1.2.130). 

@changelog_1121_li
After the database was closed, a null pointer exception could occur in Database.flush. 

@changelog_1122_li
An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException could occur in the page store (eg. on "delete from table"). Fixed. 

@changelog_1123_h2
Version 1.2.130 (2010-02-26)

@changelog_1124_li
EXPLAIN: The query plan now contains ".tableScan" if a table scan is used. 

@changelog_1125_li
IN(..): when combining and IN(..) condition with a condition that didn't use an index, the result could contain duplicate rows. 

@changelog_1126_li
IN(..): the index was not used if there were multiple IN(..) conditions. 

@changelog_1127_li
For foreign key constraints, the metadata column INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES.CONSTRAINT_NAME was not set for non-unique indexes. 

@changelog_1128_li
PostgreSQL compatibility: when using the following exception was thrown: Column "T.TYPTYPMOD" not found. Fixed. This is only when using psqlodbc_08_04*. 

@changelog_1129_li
A tool to migrate an old database from the non-page store format to the newest version has been added in src/tools/org/h2/dev/util/Migrate.java. This file is not included in the jar file currently. 

@changelog_1130_li
When using temporary tables, the database didn't shrink sometimes when closing. Also, sometimes a database could not recover normally. 

@changelog_1131_li
Large transactions could run out of heap space. The maximum size of a transaction is now much larger. 

@changelog_1132_li
The default setting for the system property h2.webMaxValueLength is now 100000 (it was 10000 before). 

@changelog_1133_li
Creating a database was delayed about 2 seconds if the directory didn't exist. 

@changelog_1134_li
Implemented INIT feature. If the database URL contains ";INIT=...;" then the DDL or DML commands following are executed on startup. Example URL: jdbc:h2:mem:test;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM '~/create.sql' (patch from Kerry Sainsbury). 

@changelog_1135_h2
Version 1.2.129 (2010-02-19)

@changelog_1136_li
The methods of the CloseListener are added to the Trigger interface. The interface CloseListener is removed. This is potentially a breaking change for existing triggers. 

@changelog_1137_li
CREATE ALIAS: error message when compiling Java code have been improved. 

@changelog_1138_li
MVCC: creating a table with an incorrect constraint could cause strange errors. 

@changelog_1139_li
Hash indexes now are only used for single column indexes. 

@changelog_1140_li
The cache types WEAK_* and TQ are no longer supported. A weak reference cache never frees up memory so it's the same as having a very large cache size. The TQ cache was not included in the jar file since a longer time, and was not tested. 

@changelog_1141_li
The file system abstraction no longer throws SQL exceptions. 

@changelog_1142_li
DatabaseEventListener.diskSpaceIsLow has changed. 

@changelog_1143_li
The CompressTool no longer throw as SQL exceptions. Instead, it throws runtime exceptions. 

@changelog_1144_li
SimpleResultSet.addColumn and addRow now can throw a IllegalStateException instead of a SQLException. 

@changelog_1145_li
When doing an index lookup, decimal values with the same value but different scale (for example 0.00 and 0.0) where not considered equal in version 1.2.128. Now they are (unlike BigDecimal.equals()). 

@changelog_1146_li
The BNF parser now uses the visitor pattern. 

@changelog_1147_li
Converting a UUID to bytes was incorrect. Because of that, updatable result sets on tables with UUID primary key did not work. 

@changelog_1148_li
The database URL property DATABASE_EVENT_LISTENER_OBJECT is no longer supported (there are problems passing objects when the PostgreSQL driver is installed as well). 

@changelog_1149_li
H2 Console: asynchronous login (using a DatabaseEventListener) is no longer supported. 

@changelog_1150_li
A workaround for a Windows socket problem has been implemented. Thanks a lot to Sergi Vladykin. 

@changelog_1151_li
The Recover tool did not convert correctly convert CLOB data with non-ASCII characters. 

@changelog_1152_li
Tools: the method run(String... args) has been renamed to runTool(String... args). 

@changelog_1153_li
Server.startWebServer(Connection) was not working as expected. 

@changelog_1154_li
The database URL option ACCESS_MODE_LOG is no longer supported. 

@changelog_1155_li
The database URL option RECOVER has currently no effect. 

@changelog_1156_li
Converting an old (non-page store) database is no longer supported using this version. 

@changelog_1157_li
The following system properties are no longer supported: h2.overflowExceptions, h2.optimizeDropDependencies, h2.optimizeGroupSorted, h2.optimizeMinMax, h2.optimizeNot, h2.optimizeIn, h2.optimizeInJoin, h2.reuseSpace*. Most of then were there for a long time, but always with the same value. There was no unit test with the other value. So changing them was potentially dangerous (not a lot, but still). 

@changelog_1158_li
The setting LOG has currently no effect (it only had an effect when the page store was disabled). 

@changelog_1159_li
Disabling the page store is no longer supported. The old storage mechanism has been removed, shrinking the jar file size by almost 10%. 

@changelog_1160_li
The translated resources are now stored in UTF-8 format. 

@changelog_1161_li
The Windows service wrapper now detects if multiple versions of H2 are installed. 

@changelog_1162_h2
Version 1.2.128 (2010-01-30)

@changelog_1163_li
There are known errors on rollback when the page store is disabled and at the same time MVCC is used. See http://code.google.com/p/h2database/issues/detail?id=158 

@changelog_1164_li
The DeleteDbFiles tool deleted all files in the .lob.db directory, even files that didn't belong to the database. 

@changelog_1165_li
Automatic conversion of old databases to the page store format failed if the database contained LOB files. 

@changelog_1166_li
Nested subqueries didn't work for INSERT INTO and IN(..). Example: insert into test ((select 1)); 

@changelog_1167_li
If the database was already closed using SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY, closing a second connection could throw a NullPointerException if there was a local temporary table. 

@changelog_1168_li
Less classes are loaded when using the database in embedded mode. 

@changelog_1169_li
The information schema tables are only initialized when needed. This reduces memory usage and speeds up creating in-memory databases. Each in-memory database needs about 8 KB of heap memory. 

@changelog_1170_li
Nested UNION/INTERSECT queries with brackets could produce the wrong result if used within a subquery. Example: select count(*) from (select 1 union (select 2 intersect select 2)) x; 

@changelog_1171_li
Comparing an column against a constant expression with a higher precision or length than the column could give wrong results (the expression was truncated before comparing). 

@changelog_1172_li
Improved PostgreSQL compatibility (support SHOW DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION). 

@changelog_1173_li
Documentation: the javadocs for Csv.write and read used the wrong default charset. 

@changelog_1174_li
MVCC: if the table was locked in exclusive mode (such as SELECT ... FOR UPDATE), another session could query the table. This is now longer possible. 

@changelog_1175_li
If a FOR UPDATE query was executed twice (using a PreparedStatement), the table was not locked. 

@changelog_1176_li
Triggers: INSTEAD OF triggers are now supported. Such triggers can be defined on views. 

@changelog_1177_li
New system property h2.identifiersToUpper. If set to false, identifiers in SQL statements are case sensitive even if they are not quoted. 

@changelog_1178_li
Slightly improved performance if the table is already locked. 

@changelog_1179_li
CompressLZF: faster decompression. 

@changelog_1180_li
PgServer: the wrong size was sent for VARCHAR data. Thanks again to Sergi Vladykin for the patch. 

@changelog_1181_li
Serialized access mode (server-less multi-connection mode): fixed getGeneratedKeys() for sequences. 

@changelog_1182_h2
Version 1.2.127 (2010-01-15)

@changelog_1183_li
Serialized access mode (server-less multi-connection mode): sequences did not work as expected (there were gaps in generated values when using multiple connections). 

@changelog_1184_li
Page store: new databases can not be opened with older versions. 

@changelog_1185_li
Page store: adding data to new database is now faster. 

@changelog_1186_li
File system: getting the file name from a path is now faster. This should speed up BLOB and CLOB access. 

@changelog_1187_li
PgServer: incorrect SQL types were returned in result set meta data. Concurrently opening a database could fail (PG catalog initialization was not synchronized). Thanks a lot to Sergi Vladykin for providing the patches! 

@changelog_1188_li
SHOW COLUMNS did not work correctly if there where multiple indexes on the same columns. 

@changelog_1189_li
Page store: the wrong write count was written to the database header. This could cause the server-less multi-connection mode to fail. 

@changelog_1190_li
Result sets larger than 2 GB threw an exception "Negative seek offset". Fixed. 

@changelog_1191_li
If the system property h2.check was set to false, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException could occur. 

@changelog_1192_li
Alter table is now supported even if a table has views defined. 

@changelog_1193_li
Fulltext search: exceptions within the fulltext search package had the wrong SQL state. 

@changelog_1194_li
The Lucene fulltext search ignored transaction rollback. Fixed using a trigger on rollback. 

@changelog_1195_li
Trigger can now be called on rollback. 

@changelog_1196_li
The shell script h2.sh ignored command line line arguments. 

@changelog_1197_li
When running H2 in the Google AppEngine for Java, a AccessControlException could be thrown when trying to open a read-only database. Fixed. 

@changelog_1198_li
The user home directory prefix (~) is now only expanded when followed by a slash or backslash, or standing alone. 

@changelog_1199_li
Native fulltext search: before inserting or deleting data, FT_INIT() had to be called. This is no longer required. 

@changelog_1200_li
The .trace.db file is now only created if required. 

@changelog_1201_li
Shell tool: improved PostgreSQL compatibility. 

@changelog_1202_li
Trying to open a database in read-only mode when a .lock.db file exists will now fail with a nice error message. 

@changelog_1203_li
H2 Console: data that is too long is now abbreviated as follows: text... (100000 characters). A large binary is abbreviated as follows: abcdef... (100000 bytes). 

@changelog_1204_li
Faster data conversion from BIGINT or INT to DECIMAL. 

@changelog_1205_li
Server-less multi-connection mode: try to delete log files if switching between read/write operations. 

@changelog_1206_li
CompressLZF: Faster decompress and improved javadocs 

@changelog_1207_h2
Version 1.2.126 (2009-12-18)

@changelog_1208_li
The ChangeFileEncryption tool will now fail with an exception if the database is still in use. The Backup tool will also fail except when running in quiet mode. 

@changelog_1209_li
CSVREAD: when reading the column names from the CSV file, column names that contain no special characters are considered case insensitive now. 

@changelog_1210_li
Optimization index conditions of the form 'column=NULL' (which is always false; unlike 'column IS NULL'). 

@changelog_1211_li
Script command and tool: the primary key constraint is now listed before inserting the data. This will result in a smaller database when using the page store. 

@changelog_1212_li
Statements with IN(SELECT..) conditions could produce the wrong result. Example: index on id, name; query: select * from test where id between 1 and 3 and name in (select 'World'). 

@changelog_1213_li
Statements with IN(..) conditions could produce the wrong result when using views or nested select statements. Example: index on id; index on name; query: select * from (select * from test) where id=1 and name in('a', 'b'). select * from (select * from test) where id=1 and name in('Hello', 'World'). 

@changelog_1214_li
Page store: a rollback of a relatively large transaction could fail with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or a 'row not found' exception in the PageBtreeIndex in some cases. 

@changelog_1215_li
JaQu: the decompiler has been improved, and a few test cases already work. It is still incomplete however. 

@changelog_1216_li
LIKE: any letter is now allowed after the escape character (which is still '\' by default). Previously, an exception was thrown (unlike other databases) if it was not the escape character, '_' or '%'. If the escape character appears at the end of the pattern, the result is it is ignored (like PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server). 

@changelog_1217_li
The reserve heap memory is no longer used. 

@changelog_1218_li
Database.checkpoint() could throw a NullPointerException. 

@changelog_1219_h2
Version 1.2.125 (2009-12-06)

@changelog_1220_li
Lucene fulltext search: the Lucene field names now match the table column names, except if the column names start with _ (in which case another _ is prepended). Unfortunately this change means existing fulltext indexes need to be re-built. 

@changelog_1221_li
The shell tool now has a very simple statement history. 

@changelog_1222_li
The zip file system implementation now supports the '~' home directory prefix. Example database URL: jdbc:h2:zip:~/test.zip!/test 

@changelog_1223_li
Right outer joins on tables that were already 'inner joined' was processed incorrectly. 

@changelog_1224_li
Temporary files from LOB objects were not deleted early enough when using the server mode. 

@changelog_1225_li
Trying to alter a temporary table threw a strange exception. It is still not possible to do that, but the exception message is better now. 

@changelog_1226_li
When the system property h2.maxMemoryRowsDistinct was set, and using SELECT DISTINCT, the temporary table was not correctly dropped. This could cause problems in recovery when the process was killed. 

@changelog_1227_li
Trigger that are called before a select statement are now supported. This allows to create tables that work like materialized views. 

@changelog_1228_li
Non-row based triggers were called even if the action didn't match the declared action (INSERT triggers were also called when deleting rows). This has been changed. The MERGE statement calls both INSERT and DELETE triggers. 

@changelog_1229_li
Statements with IN(..) conditions could produce the wrong result or a data conversion error (since version 1.2.120). Examples: index on id, name, condition: id=1 and name in('Hello', 'x'); index on id, query: select * from (select * from test) where id=1 and name in('Hello', 'World'). 

@changelog_1230_li
The CompressTool was not multithreading safe. Because of this, the following database operations where also not multithreading safe (even when using different databases): the SCRIPT command (only when using compression), the COMPRESS function, and storing CLOB or BLOB data (only when compression is enabled). 

@changelog_1231_li
The compression algorithm "LZF" is now about 33% faster than before when compressing small block (around 2 KB). It is much faster than Deflate, but the compression ratio is lower. Some of the optimizations are from Sam Van Oort, thanks a lot! 

@changelog_1232_li
Compressing large blocks of data didn't work when using the "Deflate" compression algorithm. Compressing a lot of data could run out of heap memory. 

@changelog_1233_li
The test cases don't access the file system directly, this simplifies GAE for Java testing. Thanks to Vince Bonfanti. 

@changelog_1234_li
More bugs in the server-less multi-connection mode have been fixed. 

@changelog_1235_li
When running against an old database, the SCRIPT statement could generate a SQL script that contained duplicate indexes (PRIMARY_KEY_E). 

@changelog_1236_li
JdbcConnectionPool.getConnection() could throw a NullPointerException. 

@changelog_1237_li
User defined functions: the source code is now available using SELECT SOURCE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FUNCTION_ALIASES. 

@changelog_1238_li
User defined functions with source code didn't work after re-opening the database. 

@changelog_1239_li
The newsfeeds are now Atom 1.0 standard compliant. 

@changelog_1240_li
The database is now closed after an out of memory exception, because the database could get corrupt otherwise. 

@changelog_1241_li
Better error message if both AUTO_SERVER and SERIALIZED parameters are set to TRUE. 

@changelog_1242_li
Drop table did not delete lob files in old file store (not PAGE_STORE). 

@changelog_1243_h2
Version 1.2.124 (2009-11-20)

@changelog_1244_li
Clustering: there is now a way to detect which cluster instances are running. 

@changelog_1245_li
ConvertTraceFile: the SQL statement statistics are better formatted (newline are removed). 

@changelog_1246_li
The file lock thread is now stopped when the database is closed. 

@changelog_1247_li
Issue 140: the Script tool now supports writing to a stream. 

@changelog_1248_li
Issue 138: the trace output of Statement.execute(String, int) and executeUpdate was incorrect. 

@changelog_1249_li
Page store: new databases can not be opened with older versions. 

@changelog_1250_li
Page store: multi-column indexes didn't work if the cache was very small. 

@changelog_1251_li
Page store: opening a database could theoretically result in an endless loop. 

@changelog_1252_li
Page store: adding large indexed columns could get very slow. 

@changelog_1253_li
Page store: after a duplicate key exception, an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException could be thrown (only for very large rows). 

@changelog_1254_li
Page store: the recover tool sometimes generated a script file that contained duplicate data. 

@changelog_1255_li
Page store: sometimes opening a read-only database failed. 

@changelog_1256_li
Page store: opening a database sometimes failed if large rows where updated, or if a table was truncated before. 

@changelog_1257_li
Page store: when using a very small page size (128 bytes or smaller), writing a large row could result in an endless recursion. This is only a theoretical problem, as the page size is 2 KB. 

@changelog_1258_li
Page store: getting the min value from a descending index with NULL entries could return the wrong result. 

@changelog_1259_li
Page store: improved auto-recovery after power failure. 

@changelog_1260_li
The JDBC client did not detect that it was not talking to an H2 server. This could result in strange exceptions when trying to connect to another kind of server. 

@changelog_1261_li
User defined functions can be created with source code. Example: CREATE ALIAS HI AS 'String hi() { return "Hello"; }' 

@changelog_1262_li
Database file lock: the exception "lock file modified in the future" is no longer thrown; instead, opening the file will be delayed by 2 seconds. 

@changelog_1263_li
Inserting LOBs got slower each time the process was restarted. It could loop endlessly after about 1000 process restarts. 

@changelog_1264_li
Issue 117: Multi-version concurrency: concurrent MERGE statements now work. 

@changelog_1265_li
Improved read-only database detection. 

@changelog_1266_h2
Version 1.2.123 (2009-11-08)

@changelog_1267_li
Page store: new databases can not be opened with older versions. 

@changelog_1268_li
Page store: updating large rows (rows with more than 2000 bytes of data) could corrupt the database. 

@changelog_1269_li
Page store: inserting very large rows failed with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. 

@changelog_1270_li
When using multi-threaded kernel mode, setting disabling locking (LOCK_MODE=0) will now throw an exception. At this time this combination will result in corruption when multiple threads try to update the same table. 

@changelog_1271_li
The fulltext search methods and fields are now protected instead of private, to make the classes more easily extensible. 

@changelog_1272_li
The Lucene fulltext search now also returns the score. 

@changelog_1273_li
 New function SCOPE_IDENTITY() to avoid problems when inserting rows in a trigger. 

@changelog_1274_li
Statement.getGeneratedKeys() returned the wrong value if a trigger changed the identity value after inserting the row. 

@changelog_1275_li
Improved error messages: identifiers and values are now quoted. 

@changelog_1276_li
Improved error message when casting a value failed: the column name and type is included in the message. 

@changelog_1277_li
Improved support for GAE for Java thanks to Vince Bonfanti. 

@changelog_1278_h2
Version 1.2.122 (2009-10-28)

@changelog_1279_li
The native fulltext search now supports streaming CLOB data. 

@changelog_1280_li
If the database URL ends with ;PAGE_STORE=TRUE and a database in the old format exists, it is automatically converted to the new page store format if possible. A backup of the database is created first. Automatic conversion is not supported if the database was not closed normally (if it contains uncommitted transactions). 

@changelog_1281_li
Dropping the current user is now allowed if another admin user exists. 

@changelog_1282_li
Values of type BINARY or BLOB could not be converted to the data type OTHER. 

@changelog_1283_li
SHUTDOWN COMPACT now fully compacts the database. 

@changelog_1284_li
New system properties h2.maxCompactCount and h2.maxCompactTime to allow changing the default behavior (at most 2 seconds compacting when closing the database). 

@changelog_1285_li
New sorted insert optimization (see Performance / Database Performance Tuning). 

@changelog_1286_li
Issue 116: The files h2*-sources.jar and h2*-javadoc.jar are now in the Maven repository. 

@changelog_1287_li
Page store: opening a large database was slow if it was not closed before. 

@changelog_1288_li
Page store: new write and read counters in the meta data table. Use SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS WHERE NAME IN( 'info.FILE_WRITE_TOTAL', 'info.FILE_WRITE', 'info.FILE_READ', 'info.CACHE_MAX_SIZE', 'info.CACHE_SIZE') 

@changelog_1289_li
The SQL syntax is documented using (railroad) diagrams. The diagrams are HTML. 

@changelog_1290_li
The documentation is no longer available in Japanese because the translation was too much out of sync. Please use the Google translation instead. 

@changelog_1291_li
Certain queries were not sorted if subselect queries were involved 

@changelog_1292_li
More bugs in the server-less multi-connection mode have been fixed: 90097 The database is read only, caches must be cleared on reconnect, etc. 

@changelog_1293_h2
Version 1.2.121 (2009-10-11)

@changelog_1294_li
Better support GaeVFS (Google App Engine Virtual File System) thanks to Thanks to Vince Bonfanti. 

@changelog_1295_li
CSVREAD didn't close the file. Thanks to Vince Bonfanti for the patch! 

@changelog_1296_li
If a database in the old format exists, it is now used. The system property is used for new databases, or if databases exist in both formats. In any case, the flag in the URL overrides this logic. 

@changelog_1297_li
Page store bugs were fixed. Large values in indexed columns could corrupt the index. 

@changelog_1298_li
The page store did not work when using Retrotranslator (because the Retrotranslator doesn't support Integer.reverse and Long.reverse). 

@changelog_1299_li
New system property h2.pageStoreTrim to disable shrinking the database when closing (disabled by default, meaning by default the database is trimmed). 

@changelog_1300_h2
Version 1.2.120 (2009-10-04)

@changelog_1301_li
This is a beta version. 

@changelog_1302_li
Large updates could throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in RowList.writeRow. 

@changelog_1303_li
In version 1.2, the following system properties are now enabled by default: h2.pageStore, h2.nullConcatIsNull, h2.optimizeInList. The default value for h2.defaultMaxLengthInplaceLob is now 4096 (it was 1024 with version 1.1). 

@changelog_1304_li
New databases are now stored in the new 'page store' file format. Existing databases are kept in the old file format. To use the old file format, append ;PAGE_STORE=FALSE to the database URL or set the system property h2.pageStore to false. 

@changelog_1305_li
Issue 125: Renaming primary keys was not persistent. Fixed. Unfortunately, databases created by this version can not be opened with older versions because of this change. 

@changelog_1306_li
Issue 124: Hibernate schema validation failed for decimal/numeric columns. This problem is fixed in the Hibernate dialect that is included with H2 (src/tools/org/hibernate/dialect/H2Dialect.java.txt), but not in Hibernate yet. 

@changelog_1307_li
PostgreSQL compatibility: function LASTVAL() as an alias for IDENTITY(). 

@changelog_1308_li
Linked tables now support default values when inserting, updating or merging. 

@changelog_1309_li
Bugfixes in the page store. 

@changelog_1310_li
Possibility to set a vendor id in Constants.java, so that unofficial builds are distinguishable from official releases. 

@changelog_1311_li
Allow writing to linked tables in readonly databases. 

@changelog_1312_h2
Version 1.1.119 (2009-09-26)

@changelog_1313_li
SQL statements in the exception message are no longer included if they contain '--hide--'. 

@changelog_1314_li
Temporary local tables did not always work after reconnect if AUTO_SERVER=TRUE 

@changelog_1315_li
New system property h2.defaultMaxLengthInplaceLob to change the default maximum size of an in-place LOB object. 

@changelog_1316_li
New system property h2.nullConcatIsNull to change the default null concatenation behavior. The default will be enabled in version 1.2. 

@changelog_1317_li
The cache algorithm TQ is disabled in this version, because it is unstable, and because the current implementation does not have any measurable advantages over the default. 

@changelog_1318_li
New committer: Christian Peter. He works for <a href="http://www.docware.com">Docware</a> and helped a lot finding and fixing bugs, and generally improving the database. He is now a committer. 

@changelog_1319_li
ChangeFileEncryption did not work with Lob subdirectories. Fixed. 

@changelog_1320_li
Issue 121: JaQu: new simple update and merge methods. 

@changelog_1321_li
Issue 120: JaQu didn't close result sets. 

@changelog_1322_li
Issue 119: JaQu creates wrong WHERE conditions on some inputs. 

@changelog_1323_li
The new page store mechanism is now alpha-level quality. The next release will most likely be "1.2.120 beta" where this mode is enabled by default. To use it right now, append ;PAGE_STORE=TRUE to the database URL. The file format of this mode will probably not change any more. 

@changelog_1324_li
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SYSTEM_RANGE(...) returned the wrong result. Fixed. 

@changelog_1325_li
The Recover tool now also processes the log files, however applying those changes is still a manual process. 

@changelog_1326_li
New sample application that shows how to pass data to a trigger. 

@changelog_1327_li
More bugs in the server-less multi-connection mode have been fixed: On Windows, two processes could write to the same database at the same time. 

@changelog_1328_li
When loading triggers or other client classes (static functions, database event listener, user aggregate functions, other JDBC drivers), the database now uses the context class loader if the class could not be found using Class.forName(). 

@changelog_1329_li
Updating many rows with the same CLOB or BLOB values could result in FileNotFoundException. 

@changelog_1330_li
Statement.getConnection() threw an exception if the connection was already closed. 

@changelog_1331_li
The native fulltext index kept a reference to a database after the database was closed. 

@changelog_1332_li
Non-unique in-memory hash indexes are now supported. Thanks a lot to Sergi Vladykin for the patch! 

@changelog_1333_li
The optimizer does a better job for joins if indexes are missing. 

@changelog_1334_h2
Version 1.1.118 (2009-09-04)

@changelog_1335_li
SHOW COLUMNS only listed indexed columns. 

@changelog_1336_li
When calling SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY in the server mode, the .trace.db file was not closed. 

@changelog_1337_li
DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys: the wrong constraint name was reported if there was another constraint on the same table and columns. 

@changelog_1338_li
AUTO_INCREMENT now works in the same way in ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN as in CREATE TABLE (it does not create a primary key). 

@changelog_1339_li
Native fulltext search: before searching, FT_INIT() had to be called. This is no longer required. 

@changelog_1340_li
Better support GaeVFS (Google App Engine Virtual File System). 

@changelog_1341_li
JaQu: the plan is to support natural (pure Java / Scala) conditions such as (id == 1 &amp;&amp; name.equals("Test")). A proof of concept decompiler is now included (it doesn't work yet). 

@changelog_1342_li
Various bugfixes and improvements in the page store mechanism (still experimental). 

@changelog_1343_li
PreparedStatement.setObject now converts a java.lang.Character to a string. 

@changelog_1344_li
H2 Console: PierPaolo Ucchino has completed the Italian translation. Thanks a lot! 

@changelog_1345_li
Various tools now use Java 5 var-args, such as main the methods and SimpleResultSet.addRow. 

@changelog_1346_li
H2 Console: indexes of tables of non-default schemas are now also listed. 

@changelog_1347_li
Issue 111: Multi-version concurrency / duplicate primary key after rollback. 

@changelog_1348_li
Issue 110: Multi-version concurrency / wrong exception is thrown. 

@changelog_1349_li
Parser: sequenceName.NEXTVAL and CURRVAL did not respect the schema search path. 

@changelog_1350_li
Issue 101: The following sequence could throw the exception "Row not found when trying to delete": start a transaction, insert many rows, delete many rows, rollback. The number of rows depends on the cache size. 

@changelog_1351_li
The stack trace of very common exceptions is no longer written to the .trace.db file by default. 

@changelog_1352_li
An optimization for OR is implemented, but disabled by default. Expressions of the type X=1 OR X=2 are converted to X IN(1, 2). To enable, set the system property h2.optimizeInList to true before loading the H2 JDBC driver. 

@changelog_1353_li
An optimization for IN(..) and IN(SELECT...) is implemented, but disabled by default. To enable, set the system property h2.optimizeInList to true before loading the H2 JDBC driver. If enabled, this overrides h2.optimizeIn and h2.optimizeInJoin. Unlike now, this optimization will also speed up updates and deletes. 

@changelog_1354_h2
Version 1.1.117 (2009-08-09)

@changelog_1355_li
New committer: Sam Van Oort has been contributing to H2 since quite some time in many ways (on the mailing list, documentation, and in the form of patches). He is now a committer. 

@changelog_1356_li
JaQu: the order of the fields in the database no longer needs to match the order in the database. 

@changelog_1357_li
Issue 103: MVCC: the setting MAX_MEMORY_UNDO can currently not be supported when using multi-version concurrency, that means the complete undo log must fit in memory. 

@changelog_1358_li
LIKE: the escape mechanism can now be disable using ESCAPE ''. The default escape character can be changed using the system property h2.defaultEscape. The default is still '\' (as in MySQL and PostgreSQL). 

@changelog_1359_li
Views using functions were not re-evaluated when necessary. 

@changelog_1360_li
Improved MySQL compatibility for SHOW COLUMNS. 

@changelog_1361_li
Improved PostgreSQL compatibility for timestamp literals with timezone. 

@changelog_1362_li
Sergi Vladykin translated the error messages to Russian. Thanks a lot! 

@changelog_1363_li
Support for Java 6 DatabaseMetaData.getTables, getColumns, getProcedures, and getProcedureColumns. 

@changelog_1364_li
Issue 101: Rollback of a large transaction (more than 100000 rows) could fail. 

@changelog_1365_li
Various bugfixes and improvements in the page store mechanism (still experimental). 

@changelog_1366_li
The functions LENGTH, OCTET_LENGTH, and BIT_LENGTH now return BIGINT. 

@changelog_1367_li
Data types CLOB and BLOB: the maximum precision was Integer.MAX_VALUE, it is now Long.MAX_VALUE. 

@changelog_1368_li
Multi-threaded kernel: creating and dropping temporary database objects and the potentially free pages list was not correctly synchronized. Thanks a lot to Eric Faulhaber for the test case and patch! 

@changelog_1369_li
Parsing SQL script files is now faster. 

@changelog_1370_li
CSV reading is now faster. 

@changelog_1371_li
SimpleResultSet.newInstance(SimpleRowSource rs) did not work. 

@changelog_1372_h2
Version 1.1.116 (2009-07-18)

@changelog_1373_li
Server-less multi-connection mode: more bugs are fixed. 

@changelog_1374_li
The built-in help (INFORMATION_SCHEMA.HELP) is smaller, shrinking the jar file size a bit. 

@changelog_1375_li
H2 Console: column of tables of non-default schemas are now also listed, except for schemas starting with 'INFO'. 

@changelog_1376_li
ALTER TABLE: removing an auto-increment or identity column didn't remove the sequence. 

@changelog_1377_li
Creating indexes is now a bit faster. 

@changelog_1378_li
PG Server: new system property h2.pgClientEncoding to explicitly set the encoding for clients that don't send the encoding (the default encoding is UTF-8). Thanks a lot to Sergi Vladykin for the patch! 

@changelog_1379_li
PG Server: improved compatibility by using the type ids of the PostgreSQL driver. Thanks a lot to Sergi Vladykin for the patch! 

@changelog_1380_li
H2 Console: Oracle system tables are no longer listed, improving performance. 

@changelog_1381_li
Result sets are now read-only except if the statement or prepared statement was created with the concurrency ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE. This change is required because the old behavior (all result set are updatable) violated the JDBC spec. For backward compatibility, use the system property h2.defaultResultSetConcurrency. 

@changelog_1382_li
New system property h2.defaultResultSetConcurrency to change the default result set concurrency. 

@changelog_1383_li
JDBC: using an invalid result set type or concurrency now throws an exception. 

@changelog_1384_li
If a pooled connection was not closed but garbage collected, a NullPointerException could occur. 

@changelog_1385_li
Fulltext search: a NullPointerException was thrown when updating a value that was NULL previously. 

@changelog_1386_li
The Recover tool did not work with .data.db files of the wrong size. 

@changelog_1387_li
Triggers: if there was an exception when initializing a trigger, this exception could be hidden, and in some cases (specially when using the Lucene fulltext index mechanism) a NullPointerException was thrown later on. Now the exception that occurred on init is thrown when changing data. 

@changelog_1388_li
The soft-references cache (CACHE_TYPE=SOFT_LRU) could throw a NullPointerException. 

@changelog_1389_li
To enable the new page store mechanism, append ;PAGE_STORE=TRUE to the database URL. or set the system property h2.pageStore to true. This mechanism is still experimental, and the file format will change, but it is quite stable now.

I Have a Problem or Feature Request

@faq_1016_p
 Please read the <a href="build.html#support">support checklist</a>. 

@faq_1017_h3
Are there Known Bugs? When is the Next Release?

@faq_1018_p
 Usually, bugs get fixes as they are found. There is a release every few weeks. Here is the list of known and confirmed issues: 

@faq_1019_li
Apache Harmony: there seems to be a bug in Harmony that affects H2. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-6505">HARMONY-6505</a>. 

@faq_1020_li
Tomcat and Glassfish 3 set most static fields (final or non-final) to <code>null</code> when unloading a web application. This can cause a <code>NullPointerException</code> in H2 versions 1.1.107 and older, and may still not work in newer versions. Please report it if you run into this issue. In Tomcat &gt;= 6.0 this behavior can be disabled by setting the system property <code>org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES=false</code>, however Tomcat may then run out of memory. A known workaround is to put the <code>h2*.jar</code> file in a shared <code>lib</code> directory (<code>common/lib</code>). 

@faq_1021_li
Some problems have been found with right outer join. Internally, it is converted to left outer join, which does not always produce the same results as other databases when used in combination with other joins. 

@faq_1022_li
When using Install4j before 4.1.4 on Linux and enabling <code>pack200</code>, the <code>h2*.jar</code> becomes corrupted by the install process, causing application failure. A workaround is to add an empty file <code>h2*.jar.nopack</code> next to the <code>h2*.jar</code> file. This problem is solved in Install4j 4.1.4. 

@faq_1023_p
 For a complete list, see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/h2database/issues/list">Open Issues</a>. 

@faq_1024_h3
Is this Database Engine Open Source?

@faq_1025_p
 Yes. It is free to use and distribute, and the source code is included. See also under license. 

@faq_1026_h3
My Query is Slow

@faq_1027_p
 Slow <code>SELECT</code> (or <code>DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE</code>) statement can have multiple reasons. Follow this checklist: 

@faq_1028_li
Run <code>ANALYZE</code> (see documentation for details). 

@faq_1029_li
Run the query with <code>EXPLAIN</code> and check if indexes are used (see documentation for details). 

@faq_1030_li
If required, create additional indexes and try again using <code>ANALYZE</code> and <code>EXPLAIN</code>. 

@faq_1031_li
If it doesn't help please report the problem. 

@faq_1032_h3
How to Create a New Database?

@faq_1033_p
 By default, a new database is automatically created if it does not yet exist. See <a href="tutorial.html#creating_new_databases">Creating New Databases</a>. 

@faq_1034_h3
How to Connect to a Database?

@faq_1035_p
 The database driver is <code>org.h2.Driver</code>, and the database URL starts with <code>jdbc:h2:</code>. To connect to a database using JDBC, use the following code: 

@faq_1036_h3
Where are the Database Files Stored?

@faq_1037_p
 When using database URLs like <code>jdbc:h2:~/test</code>, the database is stored in the user directory. For Windows, this is usually <code>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;userName&gt;</code>. If the base directory is not set (as in <code>jdbc:h2:test</code>), the database files are stored in the directory where the application is started (the current working directory). When using the H2 Console application from the start menu, this is <code>&lt;Installation Directory&gt;/bin</code>. The base directory can be set in the database URL. A fixed or relative path can be used. When using the URL <code>jdbc:h2:file:data/sample</code>, the database is stored in the directory <code>data</code> (relative to the current working directory). The directory is created automatically if it does not yet exist. It is also possible to use the fully qualified directory name (and for Windows, drive name). Example: <code>jdbc:h2:file:C:/data/test</code> 

@faq_1038_h3
What is the Size Limit (Maximum Size) of a Database?

@faq_1039_p
 See <a href="advanced.html#limits_limitations">Limits and Limitations</a>. 

@faq_1040_h3
Is it Reliable?

@faq_1041_p
 That is not easy to say. It is still a quite new product. A lot of tests have been written, and the code coverage of these tests is very high. Randomized stress tests are run regularly. But there are probably still bugs that have not yet been found (as with most software). Some features are known to be dangerous, they are only supported for situations where performance is more important than reliability. Those dangerous features are: 

@faq_1042_li
Using the transaction isolation level <code>READ_UNCOMMITTED</code> (<code>LOCK_MODE 0</code>) while at the same time using multiple connections. 

@faq_1043_li
Disabling database file protection using (setting <code>FILE_LOCK</code> to <code>NO</code> in the database URL). 

@faq_1044_li
Disabling referential integrity using <code>SET REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY FALSE</code>. 

@faq_1045_p
 In addition to that, running out of memory should be avoided. In older versions, OutOfMemory errors while using the database could corrupt a databases. 

@faq_1046_p
 Some areas of this database are not fully tested. When using one of those features for production, please ensure your use case is well tested (if possible with automated test cases). Those areas are: 

@faq_1047_li
Platforms other than Windows XP, Linux, Mac OS X, or JVMs other than Sun 1.5 or 1.6 

@faq_1048_li
The feature <code>MULTI_THREADED</code> 

@faq_1049_li
The features <code>AUTO_SERVER</code> and <code>AUTO_RECONNECT</code> 

@faq_1050_li
The file locking method 'Serialized' 

@faq_1051_li
The MVCC (multi version concurrency) mode 

@faq_1052_li
Cluster mode, 2-phase commit, savepoints 

@faq_1053_li
24/7 operation 

@faq_1054_li
Some operations on databases larger than 500 MB may be slower than expected 

@faq_1055_li
The optimizer may not always select the best plan 

@faq_1056_li
Fulltext search 

@faq_1057_li
Operations on LOBs over 2 GB 

@faq_1058_p
 Areas considered experimental are: 

@faq_1059_li
The PostgreSQL server 

@faq_1060_li
Multi-threading within the engine using <code>SET MULTI_THREADED=1</code> 

@faq_1061_li
Compatibility modes for other databases (only some features are implemented) 

@faq_1062_li
The soft reference cache (CACHE_TYPE=SOFT_LRU). It might not improve performance, and out of memory issues have been reported. 

@faq_1063_p
 Some users have reported that after a power failure, the database cannot be opened sometimes. In this case, use a backup of the database or the Recover tool. Please report such problems. The plan is that the database automatically recovers in all situations. 

@faq_1064_h3
Column Names are Incorrect?

@faq_1065_p
 For the query <code>SELECT ID AS X FROM TEST</code> the method <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns <code>ID</code>, I expect it to return <code>X</code>. What's wrong? 

@faq_1066_p
 This is not a bug. According the the JDBC specification, the method <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> should return the name of the column and not the alias name. If you need the alias name, use <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSetMetaData.html#getColumnLabel(int)"><code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel()</code></a>. Some other database don't work like this yet (they don't follow the JDBC specification). If you need compatibility with those databases, use the <a href="features.html#compatibility">Compatibility Mode</a>, or set the system property <a href="../javadoc/org/h2/constant/SysProperties.html#h2.aliasColumnName"><code>h2.aliasColumnName</code></a>. 

@faq_1067_p
 This also applies to DatabaseMetaData calls that return a result set. The columns in the JDBC API are column labels, not column names. 

@faq_1068_h3
Float is Double?

@faq_1069_p
 For a table defined as <code>CREATE TABLE TEST(X FLOAT)</code> the method <code>ResultSet.getObject()</code> returns a <code>java.lang.Double</code>, I expect it to return a <code>java.lang.Float</code>. What's wrong? 

@faq_1070_p
 This is not a bug. According the the JDBC specification, the JDBC data type <code>FLOAT</code> is equivalent to <code>DOUBLE</code>, and both are mapped to <code>java.lang.Double</code>. See also <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/mapping.html#1055162"> Mapping SQL and Java Types - 8.3.10 FLOAT</a>.

Why is Opening my Database Slow?

@faq_1072_p
 To find out what the problem is, use the H2 Console and click on "Test Connection" instead of "Login". After the "Login Successful" appears, click on it (it's a link). This will list the top stack traces. Then either analyze this yourself, or post those stack traces in the Google Group. 

@faq_1073_p
 To find out what the problem is, open the database in embedded mode using the H2 Console. This will print progress information. If you have many lines with 'Creating index' it is an indication that the database was not closed the last time. 

@faq_1074_p
 Other possible reasons are: the database is very big (many GB), or contains linked tables that are slow to open. 

@faq_1075_h3
Is the GCJ Version Stable? Faster?

@faq_1076_p
 The GCJ version is not as stable as the Java version. When running the regression test with the GCJ version, sometimes the application just stops at what seems to be a random point without error message. Currently, the GCJ version is also slower than when using the Sun VM. However, the startup of the GCJ version is faster than when using a VM.

Derby and HSQLDB

@features_1266_p
 After an unexpected process termination (for example power failure), H2 can usually recover safely and automatically without any user interaction. For Derby and HSQLDB, some manual steps are required ('Another instance of Derby may have already booted the database' / 'The database is already in use by another process').

@features_1273_h2
Connection Modes

@features_1274_p
 The following connection modes are supported: 

@features_1275_li
Embedded mode (local connections using JDBC) 

@features_1276_li
Server mode (remote connections using JDBC or ODBC over TCP/IP) 

@features_1277_li
Mixed mode (local and remote connections at the same time) 

@features_1278_h3
Embedded Mode

@features_1279_p
 In embedded mode, an application opens a database from within the same JVM using JDBC. This is the fastest and easiest connection mode. The disadvantage is that a database may only be open in one virtual machine (and class loader) at any time. As in all modes, both persistent and in-memory databases are supported. There is no limit on the number of database open concurrently, or on the number of open connections. 

@features_1280_h3
Server Mode

@features_1281_p
 When using the server mode (sometimes called remote mode or client/server mode), an application opens a database remotely using the JDBC or ODBC API. A server needs to be started within the same or another virtual machine, or on another computer. Many applications can connect to the same database at the same time, by connecting to this server. Internally, the server process opens the database(s) in embedded mode. 

@features_1282_p
 The server mode is slower than the embedded mode, because all data is transferred over TCP/IP. As in all modes, both persistent and in-memory databases are supported. There is no limit on the number of database open concurrently per server, or on the number of open connections. 

@features_1283_h3
Mixed Mode

@features_1284_p
 The mixed mode is a combination of the embedded and the server mode. The first application that connects to a database does that in embedded mode, but also starts a server so that other applications (running in different processes or virtual machines) can concurrently access the same data. The local connections are as fast as if the database is used in just the embedded mode, while the remote connections are a bit slower. 

@features_1285_p
 The server can be started and stopped from within the application (using the server API), or automatically (automatic mixed mode). When using the <a href="#auto_mixed_mode">automatic mixed mode</a>, all clients that want to connect to the database (no matter if it's an local or remote connection) can do so using the exact same database URL. 

@features_1286_h2
Database URL Overview

@features_1287_p
 This database supports multiple connection modes and connection settings. This is achieved using different database URLs. Settings in the URLs are not case sensitive.

Connecting to an Embedded (Local) Database

@features_1352_p
 The database URL for connecting to a local database is <code>jdbc:h2:[file:][&lt;path&gt;]&lt;databaseName&gt;</code>. The prefix <code>file:</code> is optional. If no or only a relative path is used, then the current working directory is used as a starting point. The case sensitivity of the path and database name depend on the operating system, however it is recommended to use lowercase letters only. The database name must be at least three characters long (a limitation of <code>File.createTempFile</code>). To point to the user home directory, use <code>~/</code>, as in: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test</code>. 

@features_1353_h2
In-Memory Databases

@features_1354_p
 For certain use cases (for example: rapid prototyping, testing, high performance operations, read-only databases), it may not be required to persist data, or persist changes to the data. This database supports the in-memory mode, where the data is not persisted. 

@features_1355_p
 In some cases, only one connection to a in-memory database is required. This means the database to be opened is private. In this case, the database URL is <code>jdbc:h2:mem:</code> Opening two connections within the same virtual machine means opening two different (private) databases. 

@features_1356_p
 Sometimes multiple connections to the same in-memory database are required. In this case, the database URL must include a name. Example: <code>jdbc:h2:mem:db1</code>. Accessing the same database using this URL only works within the same virtual machine and class loader environment. 

@features_1357_p
 In-memory can be accessed remotely (or from multiple processes in the same machine) using TCP/IP or SSL/TLS. An example database URL is: <code>jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/mem:db1</code>. 

@features_1358_p
 By default, closing the last connection to a database closes the database. For an in-memory database, this means the content is lost. To keep the database open, add <code>;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</code> to the database URL. To keep the content of an in-memory database as long as the virtual machine is alive, use <code>jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</code>. 

@features_1359_h2
Database Files Encryption

@features_1360_p
 The database files can be encrypted. Two encryption algorithms are supported: AES and XTEA. To use file encryption, you need to specify the encryption algorithm (the 'cipher') and the file password (in addition to the user password) when connecting to the database. 

@features_1361_h3
Creating a New Database with File Encryption

@features_1362_p
 By default, a new database is automatically created if it does not exist yet. To create an encrypted database, connect to it as it would already exist. 

@features_1363_h3
Connecting to an Encrypted Database

@features_1364_p
 The encryption algorithm is set in the database URL, and the file password is specified in the password field, before the user password. A single space separates the file password and the user password; the file password itself may not contain spaces. File passwords and user passwords are case sensitive. Here is an example to connect to a password-encrypted database: 

@features_1365_h3
Encrypting or Decrypting a Database

@features_1366_p
 To encrypt an existing database, use the <code>ChangeFileEncryption</code> tool. This tool can also decrypt an encrypted database, or change the file encryption key. The tool is available from within the H2 Console in the tools section, or you can run it from the command line. The following command line will encrypt the database <code>test</code> in the user home directory with the file password <code>filepwd</code> and the encryption algorithm AES: 

@features_1367_h2
Database File Locking

@features_1368_p
 Whenever a database is opened, a lock file is created to signal other processes that the database is in use. If database is closed, or if the process that opened the database terminates, this lock file is deleted. 

@features_1369_p
 The following file locking methods are implemented: 

@features_1370_li
The default method is <code>FILE</code> and uses a watchdog thread to protect the database file. The watchdog reads the lock file each second. 

@features_1371_li
The second method is <code>SOCKET</code> and opens a server socket. The socket method does not require reading the lock file every second. The socket method should only be used if the database files are only accessed by one (and always the same) computer. 

@features_1372_li
It is also possible to open the database without file locking; in this case it is up to the application to protect the database files. Failing to do so will result in a corrupted database. Using the method <code>NO</code> forces the database to not create a lock file at all. Please note that this is unsafe as another process is able to open the same database, possibly leading to data corruption.

@features_1373_p
 To open the database with a different file locking method, use the parameter <code>FILE_LOCK</code>. The following code opens the database with the 'socket' locking method: 

@features_1374_p
 For more information about the algorithms, see <a href="advanced.html#file_locking_protocols">Advanced / File Locking Protocols</a>. 

@features_1375_h2
Opening a Database Only if it Already Exists

@features_1376_p
 By default, when an application calls <code>DriverManager.getConnection(url, ...)</code> and the database specified in the URL does not yet exist, a new (empty) database is created. In some situations, it is better to restrict creating new databases, and only allow to open existing databases. To do this, add <code>;IFEXISTS=TRUE</code> to the database URL. In this case, if the database does not already exist, an exception is thrown when trying to connect. The connection only succeeds when the database already exists. The complete URL may look like this: 

@features_1377_h2
Closing a Database

@features_1378_h3
Delayed Database Closing

@features_1379_p
 Usually, a database is closed when the last connection to it is closed. In some situations this slows down the application, for example when it is not possible to keep at least one connection open. The automatic closing of a database can be delayed or disabled with the SQL statement <code>SET DB_CLOSE_DELAY &lt;seconds&gt;</code>. The parameter &lt;seconds&gt; specifies the number of seconds to keep a database open after the last connection to it was closed. The following statement will keep a database open for 10 seconds after the last connection was closed: 

@features_1380_p
 The value -1 means the database is not closed automatically. The value 0 is the default and means the database is closed when the last connection is closed. This setting is persistent and can be set by an administrator only. It is possible to set the value in the database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=10</code>. 

@features_1381_h3
Don't Close a Database when the VM Exits

@features_1382_p
 By default, a database is closed when the last connection is closed. However, if it is never closed, the database is closed when the virtual machine exits normally, using a shutdown hook. In some situations, the database should not be closed in this case, for example because the database is still used at virtual machine shutdown (to store the shutdown process in the database for example). For those cases, the automatic closing of the database can be disabled in the database URL. The first connection (the one that is opening the database) needs to set the option in the database URL (it is not possible to change the setting afterwards). The database URL to disable database closing on exit is: 

@features_1383_h2
Execute SQL on Connection

@features_1384_p
 Sometimes, particularly for in-memory databases, it is useful to be able to execute DDL or DML commands automatically when a client connects to a database. This functionality is enabled via the INIT property. Note that multiple commands may be passed to INIT, but the semicolon delimiter must be escaped, as in the example below. 

@features_1385_h2
Ignore Unknown Settings

@features_1386_p
 Some applications (for example OpenOffice.org Base) pass some additional parameters when connecting to the database. Why those parameters are passed is unknown. The parameters <code>PREFERDOSLIKELINEENDS</code> and <code>IGNOREDRIVERPRIVILEGES</code> are such examples; they are simply ignored to improve the compatibility with OpenOffice.org. If an application passes other parameters when connecting to the database, usually the database throws an exception saying the parameter is not supported. It is possible to ignored such parameters by adding <code>;IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE</code> to the database URL. 

@features_1387_h2
Changing Other Settings when Opening a Connection

@features_1388_p
 In addition to the settings already described, other database settings can be passed in the database URL. Adding <code>;setting=value</code> at the end of a database URL is the same as executing the statement <code>SET setting value</code> just after connecting. For a list of supported settings, see <a href="grammar.html">SQL Grammar</a>. 

@features_1389_h2
Custom File Access Mode

@features_1390_p
 Usually, the database opens the database file with the access mode <code>rw</code>, meaning read-write (except for read only databases, where the mode <code>r</code> is used). To open a database in read-only mode if the database file is not read-only, use <code>ACCESS_MODE_DATA=r</code>. Also supported are <code>rws</code> and <code>rwd</code>. This setting must be specified in the database URL: 

@features_1391_p
 For more information see <a href="advanced.html#durability_problems">Durability Problems</a>. On many operating systems the access mode <code>rws</code> does not guarantee that the data is written to the disk. 

@features_1392_h2
Multiple Connections

@features_1393_h3
Opening Multiple Databases at the Same Time

@features_1394_p
 An application can open multiple databases at the same time, including multiple connections to the same database. The number of open database is only limited by the memory available. 

@features_1395_h3
Multiple Connections to the Same Database: Client/Server

@features_1396_p
 If you want to access the same database at the same time from different processes or computers, you need to use the client / server mode. In this case, one process acts as the server, and the other processes (that could reside on other computers as well) connect to the server via TCP/IP (or SSL/TLS over TCP/IP for improved security). 

@features_1397_h3
Multithreading Support

@features_1398_p
 This database is multithreading-safe. That means, if an application is multi-threaded, it does not need to worry about synchronizing access to the database. Internally, most requests to the same database are synchronized. That means an application can use multiple threads that access the same database at the same time, however if one thread executes a long running query, the other threads need to wait. 

@features_1399_p
 An application should normally use one connection per thread. This database synchronizes access to the same connection, but other databases may not do this. 

@features_1400_h3
Locking, Lock-Timeout, Deadlocks

@features_1401_p
 The database uses table level locks to give each connection a consistent state of the data. There are two kinds of locks: read locks (shared locks) and write locks (exclusive locks). All locks are released when the transaction commits or rolls back. When using the default transaction isolation level 'read committed', read locks are already released after each statement. 

@features_1402_p
 If a connection wants to reads from a table, and there is no write lock on the table, then a read lock is added to the table. If there is a write lock, then this connection waits for the other connection to release the lock. If a connection cannot get a lock for a specified time, then a lock timeout exception is thrown. 

@features_1403_p
 Usually, <code>SELECT</code> statements will generate read locks. This includes subqueries. Statements that modify data use write locks. It is also possible to lock a table exclusively without modifying data, using the statement <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>. The statements <code>COMMIT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK</code> releases all open locks. The commands <code>SAVEPOINT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code> don't affect locks. The locks are also released when the autocommit mode changes, and for connections with autocommit set to true (this is the default), locks are released after each statement. The following statements generate locks:

ALTER TABLE TEST ...;

@features_1419_td
 CREATE INDEX ... ON TEST ...;

@features_1420_td
 DROP INDEX ...;

@features_1421_p
 The number of seconds until a lock timeout exception is thrown can be set separately for each connection using the SQL command <code>SET LOCK_TIMEOUT &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code>. The initial lock timeout (that is the timeout used for new connections) can be set using the SQL command <code>SET DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code>. The default lock timeout is persistent. 

@features_1422_h2
Database File Layout

@features_1423_p
 The following files are created for persistent databases:

@features_1453_h3
Moving and Renaming Database Files

@features_1454_p
 Database name and location are not stored inside the database files. 

@features_1455_p
 While a database is closed, the files can be moved to another directory, and they can be renamed as well (as long as all files of the same database start with the same name and the respective extensions are unchanged). 

@features_1456_p
 As there is no platform specific data in the files, they can be moved to other operating systems without problems. 

@features_1457_h3
Backup

@features_1458_p
 When the database is closed, it is possible to backup the database files. Please note that index files do not need to be backed up, because they contain redundant data, and will be recreated automatically if they don't exist. 

@features_1459_p
 To backup data while the database is running, the SQL command <code>SCRIPT</code> can be used. 

@features_1460_h2
Logging and Recovery

@features_1461_p
 Whenever data is modified in the database and those changes are committed, the changes are written to the transaction log (except for in-memory objects). The changes to the main data area itself are usually written later on, to optimize disk access. If there is a power failure, the main data area is not up-to-date, but because the changes are in the transaction log, the next time the database is opened, the changes are re-applied automatically. 

@features_1462_h2
Compatibility

@features_1463_p
 All database engines behave a little bit different. Where possible, H2 supports the ANSI SQL standard, and tries to be compatible to other databases. There are still a few differences however: 

@features_1464_p
 In MySQL text columns are case insensitive by default, while in H2 they are case sensitive. However H2 supports case insensitive columns as well. To create the tables with case insensitive texts, append <code>IGNORECASE=TRUE</code> to the database URL (example: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;IGNORECASE=TRUE</code>). 

@features_1465_h3
Compatibility Modes

@features_1466_p
 For certain features, this database can emulate the behavior of specific databases. Not all features or differences of those databases are implemented. Here is the list of currently supported modes and the differences to the regular mode: 

@features_1467_h3
DB2 Compatibility Mode

@features_1468_p
 To use the IBM DB2 mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;MODE=DB2</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE DB2</code>. 

@features_1469_li
For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 

@features_1470_li
Support for the syntax <code>[OFFSET .. ROW] [FETCH ... ONLY]</code> as an alternative for <code>LIMIT .. OFFSET</code>. 

@features_1471_li
Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 

@features_1472_h3

@features_1474_li
For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 

@features_1475_li
For unique indexes, <code>NULL</code> is distinct. That means only one row with <code>NULL</code> in one of the columns is allowed. 

@features_1476_li
Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 

@features_1477_h3
HSQLDB Compatibility Mode

@features_1478_p
 To use the HSQLDB mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;MODE=HSQLDB</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE HSQLDB</code>. 

@features_1479_li
For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 

@features_1480_li
When converting the scale of decimal data, the number is only converted if the new scale is smaller than the current scale. Usually, the scale is converted and 0s are added if required. 

@features_1481_li
For unique indexes, <code>NULL</code> is distinct. That means only one row with <code>NULL</code> in one of the columns is allowed. 

@features_1482_li
Text can be concatenated using '+'. 

@features_1483_h3
MS SQL Server Compatibility Mode

@features_1484_p
 To use the MS SQL Server mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;MODE=MSSQLServer</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE MSSQLServer</code>. 

@features_1485_li
For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 

@features_1486_li
Identifiers may be quoted using square brackets as in <code>[Test]</code>. 

@features_1487_li
For unique indexes, <code>NULL</code> is distinct. That means only one row with <code>NULL</code> in one of the columns is allowed. 

@features_1488_li
Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 

@features_1489_li
Text can be concatenated using '+'. 

@features_1490_h3
MySQL Compatibility Mode

@features_1491_p
 To use the MySQL mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;MODE=MySQL</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE MySQL</code>. 

@features_1492_li
When inserting data, if a column is defined to be <code>NOT NULL</code> and <code>NULL</code> is inserted, then a 0 (or empty string, or the current timestamp for timestamp columns) value is used. Usually, this operation is not allowed and an exception is thrown. 

@features_1493_li
Creating indexes in the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement is allowed using <code>INDEX(..)</code> or <code>KEY(..)</code>. Example: <code>create table test(id int primary key, name varchar(255), key idx_name(name));</code> 

@features_1494_li
Meta data calls return identifiers in lower case. 

@features_1495_li
When converting a floating point number to an integer, the fractional digits are not truncated, but the value is rounded. 

@features_1496_li
Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 

@features_1497_h3
Oracle Compatibility Mode

@features_1498_p
 To use the Oracle mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;MODE=Oracle</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE Oracle</code>. 

@features_1499_li
For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 

@features_1500_li
When using unique indexes, multiple rows with <code>NULL</code> in all columns are allowed, however it is not allowed to have multiple rows with the same values otherwise. 

@features_1501_li
Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 

@features_1502_h3
PostgreSQL Compatibility Mode

@features_1503_p
 To use the PostgreSQL mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;MODE=PostgreSQL</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE PostgreSQL</code>. 

@features_1504_li
For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 

@features_1505_li
When converting a floating point number to an integer, the fractional digits are not be truncated, but the value is rounded. 

@features_1506_li
The system columns <code>CTID</code> and <code>OID</code> are supported. 

@features_1507_h2
Auto-Reconnect

@features_1508_p
 The auto-reconnect feature causes the JDBC driver to reconnect to the database if the connection is lost. The automatic re-connect only occurs when auto-commit is enabled; if auto-commit is disabled, an exception is thrown. To enable this mode, append <code>;AUTO_RECONNECT=TRUE</code> to the database URL. 

@features_1509_p
 Re-connecting will open a new session. After an automatic re-connect, variables and local temporary tables definitions (excluding data) are re-created. The contents of the system table <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_STATE</code> contains all client side state that is re-created. 

@features_1510_p
 If another connection uses the database in exclusive mode (enabled using <code>SET EXCLUSIVE 1</code> or <code>SET EXCLUSIVE 2</code>), then this connection will try to re-connect until the exclusive mode ends. 

@features_1511_h2
Automatic Mixed Mode

@features_1512_p
 Multiple processes can access the same database without having to start the server manually. To do that, append <code>;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE</code> to the database URL. You can use the same database URL independent of whether the database is already open or not. This feature doesn't work with in-memory databases. 

@features_1513_p
 When using this mode, the first connection to the database is made in embedded mode, and additionally a server is started internally (as a daemon thread). If the database is already open in another process, the server mode is used automatically. 

@features_1514_p
 The application that opens the first connection to the database uses the embedded mode, which is faster than the server mode. Therefore the main application should open the database first if possible. The first connection automatically starts a server on a random port. This server allows remote connections, however only to this database (to ensure that, the client reads <code>.lock.db</code> file and sends the the random key that is stored there to the server). When the first connection is closed, the server stops. If other (remote) connections are still open, one of them will then start a server (auto-reconnect is enabled automatically). 

@features_1515_p
 All processes need to have access to the database files. If the first connection is closed (the connection that started the server), open transactions of other connections will be rolled back (this may not be a problem if you don't disable autocommit). Explicit client/server connections (using <code>jdbc:h2:tcp://</code> or <code>ssl://</code>) are not supported. This mode is not supported for in-memory databases. 

@features_1516_p
 Here is an example how to use this mode. Application 1 and 2 are not necessarily started on the same computer, but they need to have access to the database files. Application 1 and 2 are typically two different processes (however they could run within the same process). 

@features_1517_h2
Page Size

@features_1518_p
 The page size for new databases is 2 KB (2048), unless the system property <code>h2.pageSize</code> is set to a different value, or the page size is set explicitly in the database URL using <code>PAGE_SIZE=</code>. The page size of existing databases can not be changed. 

@features_1519_h2
Using the Trace Options

@features_1520_p
 To find problems in an application, it is sometimes good to see what database operations where executed. This database offers the following trace features: 

@features_1521_li
Trace to <code>System.out</code> and/or to a file 

@features_1522_li
Support for trace levels <code>OFF, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG</code> 

@features_1523_li
The maximum size of the trace file can be set 

@features_1524_li
It is possible to generate Java source code from the trace file 

@features_1525_li
Trace can be enabled at runtime by manually creating a file 

@features_1526_h3
Trace Options

@features_1527_p
 The simplest way to enable the trace option is setting it in the database URL. There are two settings, one for <code>System.out</code> (<code>TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT</code>) tracing, and one for file tracing (<code>TRACE_LEVEL_FILE</code>). The trace levels are 0 for <code>OFF</code>, 1 for <code>ERROR</code> (the default), 2 for <code>INFO</code>, and 3 for <code>DEBUG</code>. A database URL with both levels set to <code>DEBUG</code> is: 

@features_1528_p
 The trace level can be changed at runtime by executing the SQL command <code>SET TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT level</code> (for <code>System.out</code> tracing) or <code>SET TRACE_LEVEL_FILE level</code> (for file tracing). Example: 

@features_1529_h3
Setting the Maximum Size of the Trace File

@features_1530_p
 When using a high trace level, the trace file can get very big quickly. The default size limit is 16 MB, if the trace file exceeds this limit, it is renamed to <code>.old</code> and a new file is created. If another such file exists, it is deleted. To limit the size to a certain number of megabytes, use <code>SET TRACE_MAX_FILE_SIZE mb</code>. Example: 

@features_1531_h3
Java Code Generation

@features_1532_p
 When setting the trace level to <code>INFO</code> or <code>DEBUG</code>, Java source code is generated as well. This simplifies reproducing problems. The trace file looks like this: 

@features_1533_p
 To filter the Java source code, use the <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool as follows: 

@features_1534_p
 The generated file <code>Test.java</code> will contain the Java source code. The generated source code may be too large to compile (the size of a Java method is limited). If this is the case, the source code needs to be split in multiple methods. The password is not listed in the trace file and therefore not included in the source code. 

@features_1535_h2
Using Other Logging APIs

@features_1536_p
 By default, this database uses its own native 'trace' facility. This facility is called 'trace' and not 'log' within this database to avoid confusion with the transaction log. Trace messages can be written to both file and <code>System.out</code>. In most cases, this is sufficient, however sometimes it is better to use the same facility as the application, for example Log4j. To do that, this database support SLF4J. 

@features_1537_a
SLF4J

@features_1538_p
 is a simple facade for various logging APIs and allows to plug in the desired implementation at deployment time. SLF4J supports implementations such as Logback, Log4j, Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL), Java logging, x4juli, and Simple Log. 

@features_1539_p
 To enable SLF4J, set the file trace level to 4 in the database URL: 

@features_1540_p
 Changing the log mechanism is not possible after the database is open, that means executing the SQL statement <code>SET TRACE_LEVEL_FILE 4</code> when the database is already open will not have the desired effect. To use SLF4J, all required jar files need to be in the classpath. If it does not work, check the file <code>&lt;database&gt;.trace.db</code> for error messages. 

@features_1541_h2
Read Only Databases

@features_1542_p
 If the database files are read-only, then the database is read-only as well. It is not possible to create new tables, add or modify data in this database. Only <code>SELECT</code> and <code>CALL</code> statements are allowed. To create a read-only database, close the database. Then, make the database file read-only. When you open the database now, it is read-only. There are two ways an application can find out whether database is read-only: by calling <code>Connection.isReadOnly()</code> or by executing the SQL statement <code>CALL READONLY()</code>. 

@features_1543_p
 Using the <a href="#custom_access_mode">Custom Access Mode</a> <code>r</code> the database can also be opened in read-only mode, even if the database file is not read only. 

@features_1544_h2
Read Only Databases in Zip or Jar File

@features_1545_p
 To create a read-only database in a zip file, first create a regular persistent database, and then create a backup. The database must not have pending changes, that means you need to close all connections to the database first. If you are using a database named <code>test</code>, an easy way to create a zip file is using the <code>Backup</code> tool. You can start the tool from the command line, or from within the H2 Console (Tools - Backup). Please note that the database must be closed when the backup is created. Therefore, the SQL statement <code>BACKUP TO</code> can not be used. 

@features_1546_p
 When the zip file is created, you can open the database in the zip file using the following database URL: 

@features_1547_p
 Databases in zip files are read-only. The performance for some queries will be slower than when using a regular database, because random access in zip files is not supported (only streaming). How much this affects the performance depends on the queries and the data. The database is not read in memory; therefore large databases are supported as well. The same indexes are used as when using a regular database. 

@features_1548_h2
Graceful Handling of Low Disk Space Situations

@features_1549_p
 If the database needs more disk space, it calls the database event listener if one is installed. The application may then delete temporary files, or display a message and wait until the user has resolved the problem. To install a listener, run the SQL statement <code>SET DATABASE_EVENT_LISTENER</code> or use a database URL of the form <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;DATABASE_EVENT_LISTENER='com.acme.DbListener'</code> (the quotes around the class name are required). See also the <code>DatabaseEventListener</code> API. 

@features_1550_h3
Opening a Corrupted Database

@features_1551_p
 If a database cannot be opened because the boot info (the SQL script that is run at startup) is corrupted, then the database can be opened by specifying a database event listener. The exceptions are logged, but opening the database will continue. 

@features_1552_h2
Computed Columns / Function Based Index

@features_1553_p
 Function indexes are not directly supported by this database, but they can be emulated by using computed columns. For example, if an index on the upper-case version of a column is required, create a computed column with the upper-case version of the original column, and create an index for this column: 

@features_1554_p
 When inserting data, it is not required (and not allowed) to specify a value for the upper-case version of the column, because the value is generated. But you can use the column when querying the table: 

@features_1555_h2
Multi-Dimensional Indexes

@features_1556_p
 A tool is provided to execute efficient multi-dimension (spatial) range queries. This database does not support a specialized spatial index (R-Tree or similar). Instead, the B-Tree index is used. For each record, the multi-dimensional key is converted (mapped) to a single dimensional (scalar) value. This value specifies the location on a space-filling curve. 

@features_1557_p
 Currently, Z-order (also called N-order or Morton-order) is used; Hilbert curve could also be used, but the implementation is more complex. The algorithm to convert the multi-dimensional value is called bit-interleaving. The scalar value is indexed using a B-Tree index (usually using a computed column). 

@features_1558_p
 The method can result in a drastic performance improvement over just using an index on the first column. Depending on the data and number of dimensions, the improvement is usually higher than factor 5. The tool generates a SQL query from a specified multi-dimensional range. The method used is not database dependent, and the tool can easily be ported to other databases. For an example how to use the tool, please have a look at the sample code provided in <code>TestMultiDimension.java</code>. 

@features_1559_h2
Using Passwords

@features_1560_h3
Using Secure Passwords

@features_1561_p
 Remember that weak passwords can be broken regardless of the encryption and security protocols. Don't use passwords that can be found in a dictionary. Also appending numbers does not make them secure. A way to create good passwords that can be remembered is, take the first letters of a sentence, use upper and lower case characters, and creatively include special characters. Example: 

@features_1562_code
i'sE2rtPiUKtT

@features_1563_p
 from the sentence <code>it's easy to remember this password if you know the trick</code>. 

@features_1564_h3
Passwords: Using Char Arrays instead of Strings

@features_1565_p
 Java strings are immutable objects and cannot be safely 'destroyed' by the application. After creating a string, it will remain in the main memory of the computer at least until it is garbage collected. The garbage collection cannot be controlled by the application, and even if it is garbage collected the data may still remain in memory. It might also be possible that the part of memory containing the password is swapped to disk (because not enough main memory is available). 

@features_1566_p
 An attacker might have access to the swap file of the operating system. It is therefore a good idea to use char arrays instead of strings to store passwords. Char arrays can be cleared (filled with zeros) after use, and therefore the password will not be stored in the swap file. 

@features_1567_p
 This database supports using char arrays instead of string to pass user and file passwords. The following code can be used to do that: 

@features_1568_p
 This example requires Java 1.6. When using Swing, use <code>javax.swing.JPasswordField</code>. 

@features_1569_h3
Passing the User Name and/or Password in the URL

@features_1570_p
 Instead of passing the user name as a separate parameter as in <code> Connection conn = DriverManager. getConnection("jdbc:h2:~/test", "sa", "123"); </code> the user name (and/or password) can be supplied in the URL itself: <code> Connection conn = DriverManager. getConnection("jdbc:h2:~/test;USER=sa;PASSWORD=123"); </code> The settings in the URL override the settings passed as a separate parameter. 

@features_1571_h2
User-Defined Functions and Stored Procedures

@features_1572_p
 In addition to the built-in functions, this database supports user-defined Java functions. In this database, Java functions can be used as stored procedures as well. A function must be declared (registered) before it can be used. A function can be defined using source code, or as a reference to a compiled class that is available in the classpath. By default, the function aliases are stored in the current schema. 

@features_1573_h3
Referencing a Compiled Method

@features_1574_p
 When referencing a method, the class must already be compiled and included in the classpath where the database is running. Only static Java methods are supported; both the class and the method must be public. Example Java class: 

@features_1575_p
 The Java function must be registered in the database by calling <code>CREATE ALIAS ... FOR</code>: 

@features_1576_p
 For a complete sample application, see <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/Function.java</code>. 

@features_1577_h3
Declaring Functions as Source Code

@features_1578_p
 When defining a function alias with source code, the database tries to compile the source code using the Sun Java compiler (the class <code>com.sun.tools.javac.Main</code>) if the <code>tools.jar</code> is in the classpath. If not, <code>javac</code> is run as a separate process. Only the source code is stored in the database; the class is compiled each time the database is re-opened. Source code is usually passed as dollar quoted text to avoid escaping problems, however single quotes can be used as well. Example: 

@features_1579_p
 The method name (<code>nextPrime</code> in the example above) is ignored. By default, the three packages <code>java.util, java.math, java.sql</code> are imported. If different import statements are required, they must be declared at the beginning and separated with the tag <code>@CODE</code>: 

@features_1580_p
 The following template is used to create a complete Java class: 

@features_1581_h3
Function Data Type Mapping

@features_1582_p
 Functions that accept non-nullable parameters such as <code>int</code> will not be called if one of those parameters is <code>NULL</code>. Instead, the result of the function is <code>NULL</code>. If the function should be called if a parameter is <code>NULL</code>, you need to use <code>java.lang.Integer</code> instead. 

@features_1583_p
 SQL types are mapped to Java classes and vice-versa as in the JDBC API. For details, see <a href="datatypes.html">Data Types</a>. There are two special cases: <code>java.lang.Object</code> is mapped to <code>OTHER</code> (a serialized object). Therefore, <code>java.lang.Object</code> can not be used to match all SQL types (matching all SQL types is not supported). The second special case is <code>Object[]</code>: arrays of any class are mapped to <code>ARRAY</code>. 

@features_1584_h3
Functions That Require a Connection

@features_1585_p
 If the first parameter of a Java function is a <code>java.sql.Connection</code>, then the connection to database is provided. This connection does not need to be closed before returning. When calling the method from within the SQL statement, this connection parameter does not need to be (can not be) specified. 

@features_1586_h3
Functions Throwing an Exception

@features_1587_p
 If a function throws an exception, then the current statement is rolled back and the exception is thrown to the application. SQLException are directly re-thrown to the calling application; all other exceptions are first converted to a SQLException. 

@features_1588_h3
Functions Returning a Result Set

@features_1589_p
 Functions may returns a result set. Such a function can be called with the <code>CALL</code> statement: 

@features_1590_h3
Using SimpleResultSet

@features_1591_p
 A function can create a result set using the <code>SimpleResultSet</code> tool: 

@features_1592_h3
Using a Function as a Table

@features_1593_p
 A function that returns a result set can be used like a table. However, in this case the function is called at least twice: first while parsing the statement to collect the column names (with parameters set to <code>null</code> where not known at compile time). And then, while executing the statement to get the data (maybe multiple times if this is a join). If the function is called just to get the column list, the URL of the connection passed to the function is <code>jdbc:columnlist:connection</code>. Otherwise, the URL of the connection is <code>jdbc:default:connection</code>. 

@features_1594_h2
Triggers

@features_1595_p
 This database supports Java triggers that are called before or after a row is updated, inserted or deleted. Triggers can be used for complex consistency checks, or to update related data in the database. It is also possible to use triggers to simulate materialized views. For a complete sample application, see <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/TriggerSample.java</code>. A Java trigger must implement the interface <code>org.h2.api.Trigger</code>. The trigger class must be available in the classpath of the database engine (when using the server mode, it must be in the classpath of the server). 

@features_1596_p
 The connection can be used to query or update data in other tables. The trigger then needs to be defined in the database: 

@features_1597_p
 The trigger can be used to veto a change by throwing a <code>SQLException</code>. 

@features_1598_h2
Compacting a Database

@features_1599_p
 Empty space in the database file re-used automatically. When closing the database, the database is automatically compacted for up to 1 second by default. To compact more, use the SQL statement SHUTDOWN COMPACT. However re-creating the database may further reduce the database size because this will re-build the indexes. Here is a sample function to do this: 

@features_1600_p
 See also the sample application <code>org.h2.samples.Compact</code>. The commands <code>SCRIPT / RUNSCRIPT</code> can be used as well to create a backup of a database and re-build the database from the script. 

@features_1601_h2
Cache Settings

@features_1602_p
 The database keeps most frequently used data in the main memory. The amount of memory used for caching can be changed using the setting <code>CACHE_SIZE</code>. This setting can be set in the database connection URL (<code>jdbc:h2:~/test;CACHE_SIZE=131072</code>), or it can be changed at runtime using <code>SET CACHE_SIZE size</code>. The size of the cache, as represented by <code>CACHE_SIZE</code> is measured in KB, with each KB being 1024 bytes. This setting has no effect for in-memory databases. For persistent databases, the setting is stored in the database and re-used when the database is opened the next time. However, when opening an existing database, the cache size is set to at most half the amount of memory available for the virtual machine (Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()), even if the cache size setting stored in the database is larger; however the setting stored in the database is kept. Setting the cache size in the database URL or explicitly using <code>SET CACHE_SIZE</code> overrides this value (even if larger than the physical memory). To get the current used maximum cache size, use the query <code>SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS WHERE NAME = 'info.CACHE_MAX_SIZE'</code> 

@features_1603_p
 Also included is an experimental second level soft reference cache. Rows in this cache are only garbage collected on low memory. By default the second level cache is disabled. To enable it, use the prefix <code>SOFT_</code>. Example: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;CACHE_TYPE=SOFT_LRU</code>. The cache might not actually improve performance. If you plan to use it, please run your own test cases first. 

@features_1604_p
 To get information about page reads and writes, and the current caching algorithm in use, call <code>SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS</code>. The number of pages read / written is listed.

History of this Database Engine

@history_1011_p
 The development of H2 was started in May 2004, but it was first published on December 14th 2005. The main author of H2, Thomas Mueller, is also the original developer of Hypersonic SQL. In 2001, he joined PointBase Inc. where he wrote PointBase Micro, a commercial Java SQL database. At that point, he had to discontinue Hypersonic SQL. The HSQLDB Group was formed to continued to work on the Hypersonic SQL codebase. The name H2 stands for Hypersonic 2, however H2 does not share code with Hypersonic SQL or HSQLDB. H2 is built from scratch. 

@history_1012_h2
Why Java

@history_1013_p
 The main reasons to use a Java database are: 

@history_1014_li
Very simple to integrate in Java applications 

@history_1015_li
Support for many different platforms 

@history_1016_li
More secure than native applications (no buffer overflows) 

@history_1017_li
User defined functions (or triggers) run very fast 

@history_1018_li
Unicode support 

@history_1019_p
 Some think Java is too slow for low level operations, but this is no longer true. Garbage collection for example is now faster than manual memory management. 

@history_1020_p
 Developing Java code is faster than developing C or C++ code. When using Java, most time can be spent on improving the algorithms instead of porting the code to different platforms or doing memory management. Features such as Unicode and network libraries are already built-in. In Java, writing secure code is easier because buffer overflows can not occur. Features such as reflection can be used for randomized testing. 

@history_1021_p
 Java is future proof: a lot of companies support Java. Java is now open source. 

@history_1022_p
 To increase the portability and ease of use, this software depends on very few libraries. Features that are not available in open source Java implementations (such as Swing) are not used, or only used for optional features.

What is JaQu

@jaqu_1012_p
 JaQu stands for Java Query and allows to access databases using pure Java. JaQu provides a fluent interface (or internal DSL) to access a database. JaQu is something like LINQ for Java (LINQ stands for "language integrated query" and is a Microsoft .NET technology). The following JaQu code: 

@jaqu_1013_p
 stands for the SQL statement: 

@jaqu_1014_h2
Differences to Other Data Access Tools

@jaqu_1015_p
 Unlike SQL, JaQu can be easily integrated in Java applications. Because JaQu is pure Java, auto-complete in the IDE and Javadoc and are supported. Type checking is performed by the compiler. JaQu fully protects against SQL injection. 

@jaqu_1016_p
 JaQu is more a replacement for JDBC than it is a replacement for tools like Hibernate. With JaQu, you don't write SQL statements as Strings. JaQu is much smaller and simpler than other persistence frameworks such as Hibernate, but it also does not provide all the features of those. Unlike iBatis and Hibernate, no XML or annotation based configuration is required; instead the configuration (if required at all) is done in pure Java, in the application itself. 

@jaqu_1017_p
 JaQu does not require or contain any data caching mechanism. Like JDBC and iBatis, JaQu provides full control over when and what SQL statements are executed (but without having to write SQL statements as Strings). 

@jaqu_1018_h3
Restrictions

@jaqu_1019_p
 Primitive types (eg. <code>boolean, int, long, double</code>) are not supported. Use <code>java.lang.Boolean, Integer, Long, Double</code> instead. 

@jaqu_1020_h3
Why in Java?

@jaqu_1021_p
 Most people use Java in their application. Mixing Java and another language (for example Scala or Groovy) in the same application is complicated: you would need to split the application and database code. 

@jaqu_1022_h2
Current State

@jaqu_1023_p
 Currently, JaQu is only tested with the H2 database. The API may change in future versions. JaQu is not part of the h2 jar file, however the source code is included in H2, under: 

@jaqu_1024_code
src/test/org/h2/test/jaqu/*

@jaqu_1025_li
 (samples and tests) 

@jaqu_1026_code
src/tools/org/h2/jaqu/*

@jaqu_1027_li
 (framework) 

@jaqu_1028_h2
Building the JaQu Library

@jaqu_1029_p
 To create the JaQu jar file, run: <code>build jarJaqu</code>. This will create the file <code>bin/h2jaqu.jar</code>. 

@jaqu_1030_h2
Requirements

@jaqu_1031_p
 JaQu requires Java 1.5. Annotations are not need. Currently, JaQu is only tested with the H2 database engine, however in theory it should work with any database that supports the JDBC API. 

@jaqu_1032_h2
Example Code

@jaqu_1033_h2
Configuration

@jaqu_1034_p
 JaQu does not require any configuration when using the default mapping. To define table indices, or if you want to map a class to a table with a different name, or a field to a column with another name, create a function called <code>define</code> in the data class. Example:

 The method <code>define()</code> contains the mapping definition. It is called once when the class is used for the first time. Like annotations, the mapping is defined in the class itself. Unlike when using annotations, the compiler can check the syntax even for multi-column objects (multi-column indexes, multi-column primary keys and so on). Because the definition is written in regular Java, the configuration can depend on the environment. This is not possible using annotations. Unlike XML mapping configuration, the configuration is integrated in the class itself.

Natural Syntax

@jaqu_1037_p
The plan is to support more natural (pure Java) syntax in conditions. To do that, the condition class is de-compiled to a SQL condition. A proof of concept decompiler is included (but it doesn't work yet). The planned syntax is:

Other Ideas

@jaqu_1039_p
 This project has just been started, and nothing is fixed yet. Some ideas for what to implement are: 

@jaqu_1040_li
Support queries on collections (instead of using a database). 

@jaqu_1041_li
Provide API level compatibility with JPA (so that JaQu can be used as an extension of JPA). 

@jaqu_1042_li
Internally use a JPA implementation (for example Hibernate) instead of SQL directly. 

@jaqu_1043_li
Use PreparedStatements and cache them.

Summary and License FAQ

@license_1002_p
 H2 is dual licensed and available under a modified version of the MPL 1.1 (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL">Mozilla Public License</a>) or under the (unmodified) EPL 1.0 (<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php">Eclipse Public License</a>). The changes to the MPL are 

@license_1003_em
underlined</em>. There is a License FAQ for both the MPL and the EPL, most of that is applicable to the H2 License as well. 

@license_1004_li
You can use H2 for free. You can integrate it into your application (including commercial applications), and you can distribute it. 

@license_1005_li
Files containing only your code are not covered by this license (it is 'commercial friendly'). 

@license_1006_li
Modifications to the H2 source code must be published. 

@license_1007_li
You don't need to provide the source code of H2 if you did not modify anything. 

@license_1008_p
 However, nobody is allowed to rename H2, modify it a little, and sell it as a database engine without telling the customers it is in fact H2. This happened to HSQLDB: a company called 'bungisoft' copied HSQLDB, renamed it to 'RedBase', and tried to sell it, hiding the fact that it was in fact just HSQLDB. It seems 'bungisoft' does not exist any more, but you can use the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> and visit old web pages of <code>http://www.bungisoft.com</code>. 

@license_1009_p
 About porting the source code to another language (for example C# or C++): converted source code (even if done manually) stays under the same copyright and license as the original code. The copyright of the ported source code does not (automatically) go to the person who ported the code.

@license_1098_p
8.2.a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and/or <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 

@license_1099_p
8.2.b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(<a href="#section-2.1-b">b</a>) and 2.2(<a href="#section-2.2-b">b</a>) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 

@license_1100_p
8.3.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you. 

@license_1104_h3
10. United States Government End Users

@license_1105_p
 The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (October 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (September 1995).

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 

@license_1129_p
 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 

@license_1130_p
 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 

@license_1131_h3
3. REQUIREMENTS

@license_1132_p
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: 

@license_1133_p
 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 

@license_1134_p
 b) its license agreement: 

@license_1135_p
 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 

@license_1136_p
 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 

@license_1137_p
 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 

@license_1138_p
 iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

@license_1139_p
 When the Program is made available in source code form: 

@license_1140_p
 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 

@license_1141_p
 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 

@license_1142_p
 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. 

@license_1143_p
 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 

@license_1144_h3
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

@license_1145_p
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

@license_1146_p
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

@license_1147_h3
5. NO WARRANTY

@license_1148_p
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

@license_1149_h3
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

@license_1150_p
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

@license_1151_h3
7. GENERAL

@license_1152_p
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 

@license_1153_p
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

@license_1154_p
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. 

@license_1155_p
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. 

@license_1156_p
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

@links_1157_p
 From: NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Institutes of Health, USA. An open source application in the life sciences research field. This application handles chemical structures and biological responses of thousands of compounds with the potential to handle million+ compounds. It utilizes an embedded H2 database to enable flexible query/retrieval of all data including advanced chemical substructure and similarity searching. The application highlights an automated curve fitting and classification algorithm that outperforms commercial packages in the field. Commercial alternatives are typically small desktop software that handle a few dose response curves at a time. A couple of commercial packages that do handle several thousand curves are very expensive tools (&gt;60k USD) that require manual curation of analysis by the user; require a license to Oracle; lack advanced query/retrieval; and the ability to handle chemical structures.

Benchmark Results and Comments

@performance_1241_h4
H2

@performance_1242_p
 Version 1.2.137 (2010-06-06) was used for the test. For most operations, the performance of H2 is about the same as for HSQLDB. One situation where H2 is slow is large result sets, because they are buffered to disk if more than a certain number of records are returned. The advantage of buffering is: there is no limit on the result set size. The database open/close time is fixed. 

@performance_1243_h4
HSQLDB

@performance_1244_p
 Version 2.0.0 was used for the test. Cached tables are used in this test (<code>hsqldb.default_table_type=cached</code>), and the write delay is 1 second (<code>SET WRITE_DELAY 1</code>). Older versions of HSQLDB (pre 2.0) where very slow in the last test (BenchC: Transactions). 

@performance_1245_p
 A disadvantage of HSQLDB is the slow startup / shutdown time (currently not listed) when using bigger databases. The reason is, a backup of the whole data is made whenever the database is opened or closed. 

@performance_1246_h4
Derby

@performance_1247_p
 Version 10.6.1.0 was used for the test. Derby is clearly the slowest embedded database in this test. This seems to be a structural problem, because all operations are really slow. It will be hard for the developers of Derby to improve the performance to a reasonable level. A few problems have been identified: leaving autocommit on is a problem for Derby. If it is switched off during the whole test, the results are about 20% better for Derby. Derby calls <code>FileChannel.force(false)</code>, but only twice per log file (not on each commit). Disabling this call improves performance for Derby by about 2%. Unlike H2, Derby does not call <code>FileDescriptor.sync()</code> on each checkpoint. Derby supports a testing mode (system property <code>derby.system.durability=test</code>) where durability is disabled. According to the documentation, this setting should be used for testing only, as the database may not recover after a crash. Enabling this setting improves performance by a factor of 2.6 (embedded mode) or 1.4 (server mode). Even if enabled, Derby is still less than half as fast as H2 in default mode. 

@performance_1248_h4
PostgreSQL

@performance_1249_p
 Version 8.4.4 was used for the test. The following options where changed in <code>postgresql.conf: fsync = off, commit_delay = 1000</code>. PostgreSQL is run in server mode. The memory usage number is incorrect, because only the memory usage of the JDBC driver is measured. 

@performance_1250_h4
MySQL

@performance_1251_p
 Version 5.1.47-community was used for the test. MySQL was run with the InnoDB backend. The setting <code>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</code> (found in the <code>my.ini / my.cnf</code> file) was set to 0. Otherwise (and by default), MySQL is slow (around 140 statements per second in this test) because it tries to flush the data to disk for each commit. For small transactions (when autocommit is on) this is really slow. But many use cases use small or relatively small transactions. Too bad this setting is not listed in the configuration wizard, and it always overwritten when using the wizard. You need to change this setting manually in the file <code>my.ini / my.cnf</code>, and then restart the service. The memory usage number is incorrect, because only the memory usage of the JDBC driver is measured. 

@performance_1252_h4
Firebird

@performance_1253_p
 Firebird 1.5 (default installation) was tested, but the results are not published currently. It is possible to run the performance test with the Firebird database, and any information on how to configure Firebird for higher performance are welcome. 

@performance_1254_h4
Why Oracle / MS SQL Server / DB2 are Not Listed

@performance_1255_p
 The license of these databases does not allow to publish benchmark results. This doesn't mean that they are fast. They are in fact quite slow, and need a lot of memory. But you will need to test this yourself. SQLite was not tested because the JDBC driver doesn't support transactions. 

@performance_1256_h3
About this Benchmark

@performance_1257_h4
How to Run

@performance_1258_p
 This test was as follows: 

@performance_1259_h4
Separate Process per Database

@performance_1260_p
 For each database, a new process is started, to ensure the previous test does not impact the current test. 

@performance_1261_h4
Number of Connections

@performance_1262_p
 This is mostly a single-connection benchmark. BenchB uses multiple connections; the other tests use one connection. 

@performance_1263_h4
Real-World Tests

@performance_1264_p
 Good benchmarks emulate real-world use cases. This benchmark includes 4 test cases: BenchSimple uses one table and many small updates / deletes. BenchA is similar to the TPC-A test, but single connection / single threaded (see also: www.tpc.org). BenchB is similar to the TPC-B test, using multiple connections (one thread per connection). BenchC is similar to the TPC-C test, but single connection / single threaded. 

@performance_1265_h4
Comparing Embedded with Server Databases

@performance_1266_p
 This is mainly a benchmark for embedded databases (where the application runs in the same virtual machine as the database engine). However MySQL and PostgreSQL are not Java databases and cannot be embedded into a Java application. For the Java databases, both embedded and server modes are tested. 

@performance_1267_h4
Test Platform

@performance_1268_p
 This test is run on Mac OS X 10.6. No virus scanner was used, and disk indexing was disabled. The VM used is Sun JDK 1.6. 

@performance_1269_h4
Multiple Runs

@performance_1270_p
 When a Java benchmark is run first, the code is not fully compiled and therefore runs slower than when running multiple times. A benchmark should always run the same test multiple times and ignore the first run(s). This benchmark runs three times, but only the last run is measured. 

@performance_1271_h4
Memory Usage

@performance_1272_p
 It is not enough to measure the time taken, the memory usage is important as well. Performance can be improved by using a bigger cache, but the amount of memory is limited. HSQLDB tables are kept fully in memory by default; this benchmark uses 'disk based' tables for all databases. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to calculate the memory usage of PostgreSQL and MySQL, because they run in a different process than the test. This benchmark currently does not print memory usage of those databases. 

@performance_1273_h4
Delayed Operations

@performance_1274_p
 Some databases delay some operations (for example flushing the buffers) until after the benchmark is run. This benchmark waits between each database tested, and each database runs in a different process (sequentially). 

@performance_1275_h4
Transaction Commit / Durability

@performance_1276_p
 Durability means transaction committed to the database will not be lost. Some databases (for example MySQL) try to enforce this by default by calling <code>fsync()</code> to flush the buffers, but most hard drives don't actually flush all data. Calling the method slows down transaction commit a lot, but doesn't always make data durable. When comparing the results, it is important to think about the effect. Many database suggest to 'batch' operations when possible. This benchmark switches off autocommit when loading the data, and calls commit after each 1000 inserts. However many applications need 'short' transactions at runtime (a commit after each update). This benchmark commits after each update / delete in the simple benchmark, and after each business transaction in the other benchmarks. For databases that support delayed commits, a delay of one second is used. 

@performance_1277_h4
Using Prepared Statements

@performance_1278_p
 Wherever possible, the test cases use prepared statements. 

@performance_1279_h4
Currently Not Tested: Startup Time

@performance_1280_p
 The startup time of a database engine is important as well for embedded use. This time is not measured currently. Also, not tested is the time used to create a database and open an existing database. Here, one (wrapper) connection is opened at the start, and for each step a new connection is opened and then closed. 

@performance_1281_h2
PolePosition Benchmark

@performance_1282_p
 The PolePosition is an open source benchmark. The algorithms are all quite simple. It was developed / sponsored by db4o.

@performance_1388_p
 There are a few problems with the PolePosition test: 

@performance_1389_li
 HSQLDB uses in-memory tables by default while H2 uses persistent tables. The HSQLDB version included in PolePosition does not support changing this, so you need to replace <code>poleposition-0.20/lib/hsqldb.jar</code> with a newer version (for example <code>hsqldb-1.8.0.7.jar</code>), and then use the setting <code>hsqldb.connecturl=jdbc:hsqldb:file:data/hsqldb/dbbench2;hsqldb.default_table_type=cached;sql.enforce_size=true</code> in the file <code>Jdbc.properties</code>. 

@performance_1390_li
HSQLDB keeps the database open between tests, while H2 closes the database (losing all the cache). To change that, use the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:file:data/h2/dbbench;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</code> 

@performance_1391_li
The amount of cache memory is quite important, specially for the PolePosition test. Unfortunately, the PolePosition test does not take this into account. 

@performance_1392_h2
Application Profiling

@performance_1393_h3
Analyze First

@performance_1394_p
 Before trying to optimize performance, it is important to understand where the problem is (what part of the application is slow). Blind optimization or optimization based on guesses should be avoided, because usually it is not an efficient strategy. There are various ways to analyze an application. Sometimes two implementations can be compared using <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>. But this does not work for complex applications with many modules, and for memory problems. 

@performance_1395_p
 A simple way to profile an application is to use the built-in profiling tool of java. Example: 

@performance_1396_p
 Unfortunately, it is only possible to profile the application from start to end. Another solution is to create a number of full thread dumps. To do that, first run <code>jps -l</code> to get the process id, and then run <code>jstack &lt;pid&gt;</code> or <code>kill -QUIT &lt;pid&gt;</code> (Linux) or press Ctrl+C (Windows). 

@performance_1397_p
 A simple profiling tool is included in H2. To use it, the application needs to be changed slightly. Example: 

@performance_1398_p
 The profiler is built into the H2 Console tool, to analyze databases that open slowly. To use it, run the H2 Console, and then click on 'Test Connection'. Afterwards, click on "Test successful" and you get the most common stack traces, which helps to find out why it took so long to connect. You will only get the stack traces if opening the database took more than a few seconds. 

@performance_1399_h2
Database Profiling

@performance_1400_p
 The <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool generates SQL statement statistics at the end of the SQL script file. The format used is similar to the profiling data generated when using <code>java -Xrunhprof</code>. As an example, execute the the following script using the H2 Console: 

@performance_1401_p
 Now convert the <code>.trace.db</code> file using the <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool: 

@performance_1402_p
 The generated file <code>test.sql</code> will contain the SQL statements as well as the following profiling data (results vary): 

@performance_1403_h2
Database Performance Tuning

@performance_1404_h3
Keep Connections Open or Use a Connection Pool

@performance_1405_p
 If your application opens and closes connections a lot (for example, for each request), you should consider using a <a href="tutorial.html#connection_pool">connection pool</a>. Opening a connection using <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> is specially slow if the database is closed. By default the database is closed if the last connection is closed. 

@performance_1406_p
 If you open and close connections a lot but don't want to use a connection pool, consider keeping a 'sentinel' connection open for as long as the application runs, or use delayed database closing. See also <a href="features.html#closing_a_database">Closing a database</a>. 

@performance_1407_h3
Use a Modern JVM

@performance_1408_p
 Newer JVMs are faster. Upgrading to the latest version of your JVM can provide a "free" boost to performance. Switching from the default Client JVM to the Server JVM using the <code>-server</code> command-line option improves performance at the cost of a slight increase in start-up time. 

@performance_1409_h3
Virus Scanners

@performance_1410_p
 Some virus scanners scan files every time they are accessed. It is very important for performance that database files are not scanned for viruses. The database engine never interprets the data stored in the files as programs, that means even if somebody would store a virus in a database file, this would be harmless (when the virus does not run, it cannot spread). Some virus scanners allow to exclude files by suffix. Ensure files ending with <code>.db</code> are not scanned. 

@performance_1411_h3
Using the Trace Options

@performance_1412_p
 If the performance hot spots are in the database engine, in many cases the performance can be optimized by creating additional indexes, or changing the schema. Sometimes the application does not directly generate the SQL statements, for example if an O/R mapping tool is used. To view the SQL statements and JDBC API calls, you can use the trace options. For more information, see <a href="features.html#trace_options">Using the Trace Options</a>. 

@performance_1413_h3
Index Usage

@performance_1414_p
 This database uses indexes to improve the performance of <code>SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE</code>. If a column is used in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of a query, and if an index exists on this column, then the index can be used. Multi-column indexes are used if all or the first columns of the index are used. Both equality lookup and range scans are supported. Indexes are used to order result sets, but only if the condition uses the same index or no index at all. The results are sorted in memory if required. Indexes are created automatically for primary key and unique constraints. Indexes are also created for foreign key constraints, if required. For other columns, indexes need to be created manually using the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> statement. 

@performance_1415_h3
Optimizer

@performance_1416_p
 This database uses a cost based optimizer. For simple and queries and queries with medium complexity (less than 7 tables in the join), the expected cost (running time) of all possible plans is calculated, and the plan with the lowest cost is used. For more complex queries, the algorithm first tries all possible combinations for the first few tables, and the remaining tables added using a greedy algorithm (this works well for most joins). Afterwards a genetic algorithm is used to test at most 2000 distinct plans. Only left-deep plans are evaluated. 

@performance_1417_h3
Expression Optimization

@performance_1418_p
 After the statement is parsed, all expressions are simplified automatically if possible. Operations are evaluated only once if all parameters are constant. Functions are also optimized, but only if the function is constant (always returns the same result for the same parameter values). If the <code>WHERE</code> clause is always false, then the table is not accessed at all. 

@performance_1419_h3
COUNT(*) Optimization

@performance_1420_p
 If the query only counts all rows of a table, then the data is not accessed. However, this is only possible if no <code>WHERE</code> clause is used, that means it only works for queries of the form <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table</code>. 

@performance_1421_h3
Updating Optimizer Statistics / Column Selectivity

@performance_1422_p
 When executing a query, at most one index per joined table can be used. If the same table is joined multiple times, for each join only one index is used. Example: for the query <code>SELECT * FROM TEST T1, TEST T2 WHERE T1.NAME='A' AND T2.ID=T1.ID</code>, two index can be used, in this case the index on NAME for T1 and the index on ID for T2. 

@performance_1423_p
 If a table has multiple indexes, sometimes more than one index could be used. Example: if there is a table <code>TEST(ID, NAME, FIRSTNAME)</code> and an index on each column, then two indexes could be used for the query <code>SELECT * FROM TEST WHERE NAME='A' AND FIRSTNAME='B'</code>, the index on NAME or the index on FIRSTNAME. It is not possible to use both indexes at the same time. Which index is used depends on the selectivity of the column. The selectivity describes the 'uniqueness' of values in a column. A selectivity of 100 means each value appears only once, and a selectivity of 1 means the same value appears in many or most rows. For the query above, the index on NAME should be used if the table contains more distinct names than first names. 

@performance_1424_p
 The SQL statement <code>ANALYZE</code> can be used to automatically estimate the selectivity of the columns in the tables. This command should be run from time to time to improve the query plans generated by the optimizer. 

@performance_1425_h3
In-Memory (Hash) Indexes

@performance_1426_p
 Using in-memory indexes, specially in-memory hash indexes, can speed up queries and data manipulation. 

@performance_1427_p
In-memory indexes are automatically used for in-memory databases, but can also be created for persistent databases using <code>CREATE MEMORY TABLE</code>. In many cases, the rows itself will also be kept in-memory. Please note this may cause memory problems for large tables. 

@performance_1428_p
 In-memory hash indexes are backed by a hash table and are usually faster than regular indexes. However, hash indexes only supports direct lookup (<code>WHERE ID = ?</code>) but not range scan (<code>WHERE ID &lt; ?</code>). To use hash indexes, use HASH as in: <code>CREATE UNIQUE HASH INDEX</code> and <code>CREATE TABLE ...(ID INT PRIMARY KEY HASH,...)</code>. 

@performance_1429_h3
Use Prepared Statements

@performance_1430_p
 If possible, use prepared statements with parameters. 

@performance_1431_h3
Prepared Statements and IN(...)

@performance_1432_p
 Avoid generating SQL statements with a variable size IN(...) list. Instead, use a prepared statement with arrays as in the following example: 

@performance_1433_h3
Optimization Examples

@performance_1434_p
 See <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/optimizations.sql</code> for a few examples of queries that benefit from special optimizations built into the database. 

@performance_1435_h3
Cache Size and Type

@performance_1436_p
 By default the cache size of H2 is quite small. Consider using a larger cache size, or enable the second level soft reference cache. See also <a href="features.html#cache_settings">Cache Settings</a>. 

@performance_1437_h3
Data Types

@performance_1438_p
 Each data type has different storage and performance characteristics: 

@performance_1439_li
The <code>DECIMAL/NUMERIC</code> type is slower and requires more storage than the <code>REAL</code> and <code>DOUBLE</code> types. 

@performance_1440_li
Text types are slower to read, write, and compare than numeric types and generally require more storage. 

@performance_1441_li
See <a href="advanced.html#large_objects">Large Objects</a> for information on <code>BINARY</code> vs. <code>BLOB</code> and <code>VARCHAR</code> vs. <code>CLOB</code> performance. 

@performance_1442_li
Parsing and formatting takes longer for the <code>TIME</code>, <code>DATE</code>, and <code>TIMESTAMP</code> types than the numeric types. 

@performance_1443_code
SMALLINT/TINYINT/BOOLEAN

@performance_1444_li
 are not significantly smaller or faster to work with than <code>INTEGER</code> in most modes. 

@performance_1445_h3
Sorted Insert Optimization

@performance_1446_p
 To reduce disk space usage and speed up table creation, an optimization for sorted inserts is available. When used, b-tree pages are split at the insertion point. To use this optimization, add <code>SORTED</code> before the <code>SELECT</code> statement: 

@performance_1447_h2
Using the Built-In Profiler

@performance_1448_p
 A very simple Java profiler is built-in. To use it, use the following template: 

@performance_1449_h2
Fast Database Import

@performance_1450_p
 To speed up large imports, consider using the following options temporarily: 

@performance_1451_code
SET CACHE_SIZE

@performance_1452_li
 (a large cache is faster) 

@performance_1453_code
SET LOCK_MODE 0

@performance_1454_li
 (disable locking) 

@performance_1455_code
SET UNDO_LOG 0

@performance_1456_li
 (disable the session undo log) 

@performance_1457_p
 These options can be set in the database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test;CACHE_SIZE=65536;LOCK_MODE=0;UNDO_LOG=0</code>. Most of those options are not recommended for regular use, that means you need to reset them after use.

Creating primary key: always create a constraint. 

@roadmap_1429_li
Support a data type "timestamp with timezone" using java.util.Calendar. 

@roadmap_1430_li
Maybe use a different page layout: keep the data at the head of the page, and ignore the tail (don't store / read it). This may increase write / read performance depending on the file system. 

@roadmap_1431_li
Indexes of temporary tables are currently kept in-memory. Is this how it should be? 

@roadmap_1432_li
The Shell tool should support the same built-in commands as the H2 Console.

@roadmap_1439_li
Allow to access the database over HTTP (possibly using port 80) and a servlet in a REST way. 

@roadmap_1440_li
ODBC: encrypted databases are not supported because the ;CIPHER= can not be set. 

@roadmap_1441_li
Support CLOB and BLOB update, specially conn.createBlob().setBinaryStream(1); 

@roadmap_1442_li
Triggers: support user defined execution order. Oracle: CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TEST_2 BEFORE INSERT ON TEST FOR EACH ROW FOLLOWS TEST_1. SQL specifies that multiple triggers should be fired in time-of-creation order. PostgreSQL uses name order, which was judged to be more convenient. Derby: triggers are fired in the order in which they were created. 

@roadmap_1443_li
PostgreSQL compatibility: combine "users" and "roles". See: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/user-manag.html 

@roadmap_1444_li
Support NULL with a type: @meta CALL CAST(NULL AS INT) should return INT. See the ValueExpression.java (currently it returns the type of the value; it could have it's own type/precision/scale optionally, for example when created from CAST, which is implemented in Function.java). 

@roadmap_1445_li
Improve documentation of system properties: only list the property names, default values, and description. 

@roadmap_1446_li
Support running totals / cumulative sum using SUM(..) OVER(..). 

@roadmap_1447_li
Improve object memory size calculation. Use constants for known VMs, or use reflection to call java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation.getObjectSize(Object objectToSize) 

@roadmap_1448_li
Triggers: NOT NULL checks should be done after running triggers (Oracle behavior, maybe others). 

@roadmap_1449_li
Log long running transactions (similar to long running statements). 

@roadmap_1450_li
Support schema specific domains. 

@roadmap_1451_li
Some combinations of nested join with right outer join are not supported. 

@roadmap_1452_h2
Not Planned

@roadmap_1453_li
HSQLDB (did) support this: select id i from test where i&lt;0 (other databases don't). Supporting it may break compatibility. 

@roadmap_1454_li
String.intern (so that Strings can be compared with ==) will not be used because some VMs have problems when used extensively. 

@roadmap_1455_li
In prepared statements, identifier names (table names and so on) can not be parameterized. Adding such a feature would complicate the source code without providing reasonable speedup, and would slow down regular prepared statements.

Starting and Using the H2 Console

@tutorial_1023_p
 The H2 Console application lets you access a SQL database using a browser interface. This can be a H2 database, or another database that supports the JDBC API. 

@tutorial_1024_p
 This is a client / server application, so both a server and a client (a browser) are required to run it. 

@tutorial_1025_p
 Depending on your platform and environment, there are multiple ways to start the application: 

@tutorial_1026_th
OS

@tutorial_1027_th
Start

@tutorial_1028_td
Windows

@tutorial_1029_td
 Click [Start], [All Programs], [H2], and [H2 Console (Command Line)]

@tutorial_1030_td
 When using the Sun JDK 1.5, a window with the title 'H2 Console ' should appear. When using the Sun JDK 1.6, an icon will be added to the system tray: 

@tutorial_1031_td
 If you don't get the window and the system tray icon, then maybe Java is not installed correctly (in this case, try another way to start the application). A browser window should open and point to the Login page at <code>http://localhost:8082</code>. 

@tutorial_1032_td
Windows

@tutorial_1033_td
 Open a file browser, navigate to <code>h2/bin</code>, and double click on <code>h2.bat</code>.

@tutorial_1034_td
 A console window appears. If there is a problem, you will see an error message in this window. A browser window will open and point to the Login page (URL: <code>http://localhost:8082</code>). 

@tutorial_1035_td
Any

@tutorial_1036_td
 Double click on the <code>h2*.jar</code> file. This only works if the <code>.jar</code> suffix is associated with java. 

@tutorial_1037_td
Any

@tutorial_1038_td
 Open a console window, navigate to the directory <code>h2/bin</code> and type: 

@tutorial_1039_h3
Firewall

@tutorial_1040_p
 If you start the server, you may get a security warning from the firewall (if you have installed one). If you don't want other computers in the network to access the application on your machine, you can let the firewall block those connections. The connection from the local machine will still work. Only if you want other computers to access the database on this computer, you need allow remote connections in the firewall. 

@tutorial_1041_p
 It has been reported that when using Kaspersky 7.0 with firewall, the H2 Console is very slow when connecting over the IP address. A workaround is to connect using localhost, however this only works on the local machine. 

@tutorial_1042_p
 A small firewall is already built into the server: other computers may not connect to the server by default. To change this, go to 'Preferences' and select 'Allow connections from other computers'. 

@tutorial_1043_h3
Testing Java

@tutorial_1044_p
 To find out which version of Java is installed, open a command prompt and type: 

@tutorial_1045_p
 If you get an error message, you may need to add the Java binary directory to the path environment variable. 

@tutorial_1046_h3
Error Message 'Port may be in use'

@tutorial_1047_p
 You can only start one instance of the H2 Console, otherwise you will get the following error message: "The Web server could not be started. Possible cause: another server is already running...". It is possible to start multiple console applications on the same computer (using different ports), but this is usually not required as the console supports multiple concurrent connections. 

@tutorial_1048_h3
Using another Port

@tutorial_1049_p
 If the port is in use by another application, you may want to start the H2 Console on a different port. This can be done by changing the port in the file <code>.h2.server.properties</code>. This file is stored in the user directory (for Windows, this is usually in <code>Documents and Settings/&lt;username&gt;</code>). The relevant entry is webPort. 

@tutorial_1050_h3
Connecting to the Server using a Browser

@tutorial_1051_p
 If the server started successfully, you can connect to it using a web browser. JavaScript needs to be enabled. If you started the server on the same computer as the browser, open the URL <code>http://localhost:8082</code>. If you want to connect to the application from another computer, you need to provide the IP address of the server, for example: <code>http://192.168.0.2:8082</code>. If you enabled SSL on the server side, the URL needs to start with <code>https://</code>. 

@tutorial_1052_h3
Multiple Concurrent Sessions

@tutorial_1053_p
 Multiple concurrent browser sessions are supported. As that the database objects reside on the server, the amount of concurrent work is limited by the memory available to the server application. 

@tutorial_1054_h3
Login

@tutorial_1055_p
 At the login page, you need to provide connection information to connect to a database. Set the JDBC driver class of your database, the JDBC URL, user name and password. If you are done, click [Connect]. 

@tutorial_1056_p
 You can save and reuse previously saved settings. The settings are stored in a properties file (see <a href="#console_settings">Settings of the H2 Console</a>). 

@tutorial_1057_h3
Error Messages

@tutorial_1058_p
 Error messages in are shown in red. You can show/hide the stack trace of the exception by clicking on the message. 

@tutorial_1059_h3
Adding Database Drivers

@tutorial_1060_p
 Additional database drivers to connect to other databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, HSQLDB,...) can be registered by adding the Jar file location of the driver to the environment variables <code>H2DRIVERS</code> or <code>CLASSPATH</code>. Example (Windows): to add the database driver library <code>C:\Programs\hsqldb\lib\hsqldb.jar</code>, set the environment variable <code>H2DRIVERS</code> to <code>C:\Programs\hsqldb\lib\hsqldb.jar</code>. 

@tutorial_1061_p
 Multiple drivers can be set; each entry needs to be separated with a <code>;</code> (Windows) or <code>:</code> (other operating systems). Spaces in the path names are supported. The settings must not be quoted. 

@tutorial_1062_h3
Using the H2 Console

@tutorial_1063_p
 The H2 Console application has three main panels: the toolbar on top, the tree on the left, and the query / result panel on the right. The database objects (for example, tables) are listed on the left panel. Type in a SQL command on the query panel and click 'Run'. The result of the command appears just below the command. 

@tutorial_1064_h3
Inserting Table Names or Column Names

@tutorial_1065_p
 The table name and column names can be inserted in the script by clicking them in the tree. If you click on a table while the query is empty, then <code>SELECT * FROM ...</code> is added as well. While typing a query, the table that was used is automatically expanded in the tree. For example if you type <code>SELECT * FROM TEST T WHERE T.</code> then the table TEST is automatically expanded in the tree. 

@tutorial_1066_h3
Disconnecting and Stopping the Application

@tutorial_1067_p
 To log out of the database, click 'Disconnect' in the toolbar panel. However, the server is still running and ready to accept new sessions. 

@tutorial_1068_p
 To stop the server, right click on the system tray icon and select [Exit]. If you don't have the system tray icon, navigate to [Preferences] and click [Shutdown], press [Ctrl]+[C] in the console where the server was started (Windows), or close the console window. 

@tutorial_1069_h2
Special H2 Console Syntax

@tutorial_1070_p
 The H2 Console supports a few built-in commands. Those are interpreted within the H2 Console, that means they work with any database. They need to be at the beginning of a statement (before any remarks), otherwise they are not parsed correctly. If in doubt, add ';' before the command.

Settings of the H2 Console

@tutorial_1112_p
 The settings of the H2 Console are stored in a configuration file called <code>.h2.server.properties</code> in you user home directory. For Windows installations, the user home directory is usually <code>C:\Documents and Settings\[username]</code>. The configuration file contains the settings of the application and is automatically created when the H2 Console is first started. 

@tutorial_1113_h2
Connecting to a Database using JDBC

@tutorial_1114_p
 To connect to a database, a Java application first needs to load the database driver, and then get a connection. A simple way to do that is using the following code: 

@tutorial_1115_p
 This code first loads the driver (<code>Class.forName(...)</code>) and then opens a connection (using <code>DriverManager.getConnection()</code>). The driver name is <code>"org.h2.Driver"</code>. The database URL always needs to start with <code>jdbc:h2:</code> to be recognized by this database. The second parameter in the <code>getConnection()</code> call is the user name (<code>sa</code> for System Administrator in this example). The third parameter is the password. In this database, user names are not case sensitive, but passwords are. 

@tutorial_1116_h2
Creating New Databases

@tutorial_1117_p
 By default, if the database specified in the URL does not yet exist, a new (empty) database is created automatically. The user that created the database automatically becomes the administrator of this database. 

@tutorial_1118_p
 Auto-creating new database can be disabled, see <a href="features.html#database_only_if_exists">Opening a Database Only if it Already Exists</a>. 

@tutorial_1119_h2
Using the Server

@tutorial_1120_p
 H2 currently supports three server: a web server (for the H2 Console), a TCP server (for client/server connections) and an PG server (for PostgreSQL clients). Please note that only the web server supports browser connections. The servers can be started in different ways, one is using the <code>Server</code> tool. 

@tutorial_1121_h3
Starting the Server Tool from Command Line

@tutorial_1122_p
 To start the <code>Server</code> tool from the command line with the default settings, run: 

@tutorial_1123_p
 This will start the tool with the default options. To get the list of options and default values, run: 

@tutorial_1124_p
 There are options available to use other ports, and start or not start parts. 

@tutorial_1125_h3
Connecting to the TCP Server

@tutorial_1126_p
 To remotely connect to a database using the TCP server, use the following driver and database URL: 

@tutorial_1127_li
JDBC driver class: <code>org.h2.Driver</code> 

@tutorial_1128_li
Database URL: <code>jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test</code> 

@tutorial_1129_p
 For details about the database URL, see also in Features. Please note that you can't connection with a web browser to this URL. You can only connect using a H2 client (over JDBC). 

@tutorial_1130_h3
Starting the TCP Server within an Application

@tutorial_1131_p
 Servers can also be started and stopped from within an application. Sample code: 

@tutorial_1132_h3
Stopping a TCP Server from Another Process

@tutorial_1133_p
 The TCP server can be stopped from another process. To stop the server from the command line, run: 

@tutorial_1134_p
 To stop the server from a user application, use the following code: 

@tutorial_1135_p
 This function will only stop the TCP server. If other server were started in the same process, they will continue to run. To avoid recovery when the databases are opened the next time, all connections to the databases should be closed before calling this method. To stop a remote server, remote connections must be enabled on the server. Shutting down a TCP server can be protected using the option <code>-tcpPassword</code> (the same password must be used to start and stop the TCP server). 

@tutorial_1136_h2
Using Hibernate

@tutorial_1137_p
 This database supports Hibernate version 3.1 and newer. You can use the HSQLDB Dialect, or the native H2 Dialect. Unfortunately the H2 Dialect included in some versions of Hibernate is buggy. A <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3401">patch for Hibernate</a> has been submitted and is now applied. The dialect for the newest version of Hibernate is also available at <code>src/tools/org/hibernate/dialect/H2Dialect.java.txt</code>. You can rename it to <code>H2Dialect.java</code> and include this as a patch in your application, or upgrade to a version of Hibernate where this is fixed. 

@tutorial_1138_p
 When using compatibility modes such as <code>MODE=MySQL</code> when using Hibernate is not supported when using <code>H2Dialect</code>. 

@tutorial_1139_h2
Using TopLink and Glassfish

@tutorial_1140_p
 To use H2 with Glassfish (or Sun AS), set the Datasource Classname to <code>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</code>. You can set this in the GUI at Application Server - Resources - JDBC - Connection Pools, or by editing the file <code>sun-resources.xml</code>: at element <code>jdbc-connection-pool</code>, set the attribute <code>datasource-classname</code> to <code>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</code>. 

@tutorial_1141_p
 The H2 database is compatible with HSQLDB and PostgreSQL. To take advantage of H2 specific features, use the <code>H2Platform</code>. The source code of this platform is included in H2 at <code>src/tools/oracle/toplink/essentials/platform/database/DatabasePlatform.java.txt</code>. You will need to copy this file to your application, and rename it to .java. To enable it, change the following setting in persistence.xml: 

@tutorial_1142_p
 In old versions of Glassfish, the property name is <code>toplink.platform.class.name</code>. 

@tutorial_1143_p
 To use H2 within Glassfish, copy the h2*.jar to the directory <code>glassfish/glassfish/lib</code>. 

@tutorial_1144_h2
Using EclipseLink

@tutorial_1145_p
 To use H2 in EclipseLink, use the platform class <code>org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.H2Platform</code>. If this platform is not available in your version of EclipseLink, you can use the OraclePlatform instead in many case. See also <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Development/Incubator/Extensions/H2Platform">H2Platform</a>. 

@tutorial_1146_h2
Using Databases in Web Applications

@tutorial_1147_p
 There are multiple ways to access a database from within web applications. Here are some examples if you use Tomcat or JBoss. 

@tutorial_1148_h3
Embedded Mode

@tutorial_1149_p
 The (currently) simplest solution is to use the database in the embedded mode, that means open a connection in your application when it starts (a good solution is using a Servlet Listener, see below), or when a session starts. A database can be accessed from multiple sessions and applications at the same time, as long as they run in the same process. Most Servlet Containers (for example Tomcat) are just using one process, so this is not a problem (unless you run Tomcat in clustered mode). Tomcat uses multiple threads and multiple classloaders. If multiple applications access the same database at the same time, you need to put the database jar in the <code>shared/lib</code> or <code>server/lib</code> directory. It is a good idea to open the database when the web application starts, and close it when the web application stops. If using multiple applications, only one (any) of them needs to do that. In the application, an idea is to use one connection per Session, or even one connection per request (action). Those connections should be closed after use if possible (but it's not that bad if they don't get closed). 

@tutorial_1150_h3
Server Mode

@tutorial_1151_p
 The server mode is similar, but it allows you to run the server in another process. 

@tutorial_1152_h3
Using a Servlet Listener to Start and Stop a Database

@tutorial_1153_p
 Add the h2*.jar file to your web application, and add the following snippet to your web.xml file (between the <code>context-param</code> and the <code>filter</code> section): 

@tutorial_1154_p
 For details on how to access the database, see the file <code>DbStarter.java</code>. By default this tool opens an embedded connection using the database URL <code>jdbc:h2:~/test</code>, user name <code>sa</code>, and password <code>sa</code>. If you want to use this connection within your servlet, you can access as follows: 

@tutorial_1155_code
DbStarter

@tutorial_1156_p
 can also start the TCP server, however this is disabled by default. To enable it, use the parameter <code>db.tcpServer</code> in the file <code>web.xml</code>. Here is the complete list of options. These options need to be placed between the <code>description</code> tag and the <code>listener</code> / <code>filter</code> tags: 

@tutorial_1157_p
 When the web application is stopped, the database connection will be closed automatically. If the TCP server is started within the <code>DbStarter</code>, it will also be stopped automatically. 

@tutorial_1158_h3
Using the H2 Console Servlet

@tutorial_1159_p
 The H2 Console is a standalone application and includes its own web server, but it can be used as a servlet as well. To do that, include the the <code>h2*.jar</code> file in your application, and add the following configuration to your <code>web.xml</code>: 

@tutorial_1160_p
 For details, see also <code>src/tools/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. 

@tutorial_1161_p
 To create a web application with just the H2 Console, run the following command: 

@tutorial_1162_h2
CSV (Comma Separated Values) Support

@tutorial_1163_p
 The CSV file support can be used inside the database using the functions <code>CSVREAD</code> and <code>CSVWRITE</code>, or it can be used outside the database as a standalone tool. 

@tutorial_1164_h3
Reading a CSV File from Within a Database

@tutorial_1165_p
 A CSV file can be read using the function <code>CSVREAD</code>. Example: 

@tutorial_1166_h3
Importing Data from a CSV File

@tutorial_1167_p
 A fast way to load or import data (sometimes called 'bulk load') from a CSV file is to combine table creation with import. Optionally, the column names and data types can be set when creating the table. Another option is to use <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code>. 

@tutorial_1168_h3
Writing a CSV File from Within a Database

@tutorial_1169_p
 The built-in function <code>CSVWRITE</code> can be used to create a CSV file from a query. Example: 

@tutorial_1170_h3
Writing a CSV File from a Java Application

@tutorial_1171_p
 The <code>Csv</code> tool can be used in a Java application even when not using a database at all. Example: 

@tutorial_1172_h3
Reading a CSV File from a Java Application

@tutorial_1173_p
 It is possible to read a CSV file without opening a database. Example: 

@tutorial_1174_h2
Upgrade, Backup, and Restore

@tutorial_1175_h3
Database Upgrade

@tutorial_1176_p
 The recommended way to upgrade from one version of the database engine to the next version is to create a backup of the database (in the form of a SQL script) using the old engine, and then execute the SQL script using the new engine. 

@tutorial_1177_h3
Backup using the Script Tool

@tutorial_1178_p
 There are different ways to backup a database. For example, it is possible to copy the database files. However, this is not recommended while the database is in use. Also, the database files are not human readable and quite large. The recommended way to backup a database is to create a compressed SQL script file. This can be done using the <code>Script</code> tool: 

@tutorial_1179_p
 It is also possible to use the SQL command <code>SCRIPT</code> to create the backup of the database. For more information about the options, see the SQL command <code>SCRIPT</code>. The backup can be done remotely, however the file will be created on the server side. The built in FTP server could be used to retrieve the file from the server. 

@tutorial_1180_h3
Restore from a Script

@tutorial_1181_p
 To restore a database from a SQL script file, you can use the <code>RunScript</code> tool: 

@tutorial_1182_p
 For more information about the options, see the SQL command <code>RUNSCRIPT</code>. The restore can be done remotely, however the file needs to be on the server side. The built in FTP server could be used to copy the file to the server. It is also possible to use the SQL command <code>RUNSCRIPT</code> to execute a SQL script. SQL script files may contain references to other script files, in the form of <code>RUNSCRIPT</code> commands. However, when using the server mode, the references script files need to be available on the server side. 

@tutorial_1183_h3
Online Backup

@tutorial_1184_p
 The <code>BACKUP</code> SQL statement and the <code>Backup</code> tool both create a zip file with all database files. However, the contents of this file are not human readable. 

@tutorial_1185_p
 Unlike than the SCRIPT statement, the <code>BACKUP</code> statement does not lock the database objects when using the multi-threaded mode, and therefore does not block other users. The resulting backup is transactionally consistent: 

@tutorial_1186_p
 The <code>Backup</code> tool (<code>org.h2.tools.Backup</code>) can not be used to create a online backup; the database must not be in use while running this program. 

@tutorial_1187_p
 Creating a backup by copying the database files while the database is running is not supported, except if the file systems support creating snapshots. The problem is that it can't be guaranteed that the data is copied in the right order. 

@tutorial_1188_h2
Command Line Tools

@tutorial_1189_p
 This database comes with a number of command line tools. To get more information about a tool, start it with the parameter '-?', for example: 

@tutorial_1190_p
 The command line tools are: 

@tutorial_1191_code

 is used in the server mode to start a H2 server. 

@tutorial_1213_code
Shell

@tutorial_1214_li
 is a command line database tool. 

@tutorial_1215_p
 The tools can also be called from an application by calling the main or another public method. For details, see the Javadoc documentation. 

@tutorial_1216_h2
The Shell Tool

@tutorial_1217_p
 The Shell tool is a simple interactive command line tool. To start it, type: 

@tutorial_1218_p
 You will be asked for a database URL, JDBC driver, user name, and password. The connection setting can also be set as command line parameters. After connecting, you will get the list of options. The built-in commands don't need to end with a semicolon, but SQL statements are only executed if the line ends with a semicolon <code>;</code>. This allows to enter multi-line statements: 

@tutorial_1219_p
 By default, results are printed as a table. For results with many column, consider using the list mode: 

@tutorial_1220_h2
Using OpenOffice Base

@tutorial_1221_p
 OpenOffice.org Base supports database access over the JDBC API. To connect to a H2 database using OpenOffice Base, you first need to add the JDBC driver to OpenOffice. The steps to connect to a H2 database are: 

@tutorial_1222_li
Start OpenOffice Writer, go to [Tools], [Options] 

@tutorial_1223_li
Make sure you have selected a Java runtime environment in OpenOffice.org / Java 

@tutorial_1224_li
Click [Class Path...], [Add Archive...] 

@tutorial_1225_li
Select your h2 jar file (location is up to you, could be wherever you choose) 

@tutorial_1226_li
Click [OK] (as much as needed), stop OpenOffice (including the Quickstarter) 

@tutorial_1227_li
Start OpenOffice Base 

@tutorial_1228_li
Connect to an existing database; select [JDBC]; [Next] 

@tutorial_1229_li
Example datasource URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test</code> 

@tutorial_1230_li
JDBC driver class: <code>org.h2.Driver</code> 

@tutorial_1231_p
 Now you can access the database stored in the current users home directory. 

@tutorial_1232_p
 To use H2 in NeoOffice (OpenOffice without X11): 

@tutorial_1233_li
In NeoOffice, go to [NeoOffice], [Preferences] 

@tutorial_1234_li
Look for the page under [NeoOffice], [Java] 

@tutorial_1235_li
Click [Class Path], [Add Archive...] 

@tutorial_1236_li
Select your h2 jar file (location is up to you, could be wherever you choose) 

@tutorial_1237_li
Click [OK] (as much as needed), restart NeoOffice. 

@tutorial_1238_p
 Now, when creating a new database using the "Database Wizard" : 

@tutorial_1239_li
Click [File], [New], [Database]. 

@tutorial_1240_li
Select [Connect to existing database] and the select [JDBC]. Click next. 

@tutorial_1241_li
Example datasource URL: <code>jdbc:h2:~/test</code> 

@tutorial_1242_li
JDBC driver class: <code>org.h2.Driver</code> 

@tutorial_1243_p
 Another solution to use H2 in NeoOffice is: 

@tutorial_1244_li
Package the h2 jar within an extension package 

@tutorial_1245_li
Install it as a Java extension in NeoOffice 

@tutorial_1246_p
 This can be done by create it using the NetBeans OpenOffice plugin. See also <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Extensions_development_java">Extensions Development</a>. 

@tutorial_1247_h2
Java Web Start / JNLP

@tutorial_1248_p
 When using Java Web Start / JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol), permissions tags must be set in the .jnlp file, and the application .jar file must be signed. Otherwise, when trying to write to the file system, the following exception will occur: <code>java.security.AccessControlException</code>: access denied (<code>java.io.FilePermission ... read</code>). Example permission tags: 

@tutorial_1249_h2
Using a Connection Pool

@tutorial_1250_p
 For H2, opening a connection is fast if the database is already open. Still, using a connection pool improves performance if you open and close connections a lot. A simple connection pool is included in H2. It is based on the <a href="http://www.source-code.biz/snippets/java/8.htm">Mini Connection Pool Manager</a> from Christian d'Heureuse. There are other, more complex, open source connection pools available, for example the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/">Apache Commons DBCP</a>. For H2, it is about twice as faster to get a connection from the built-in connection pool than to get one using <code>DriverManager.getConnection()</code>.The build-in connection pool is used as follows: 

@tutorial_1251_h2
Fulltext Search

@tutorial_1252_p
 H2 includes two fulltext search implementations. One is using Apache Lucene, and the other (the native implementation) stores the index data in special tables in the database. 

@tutorial_1253_h3
Using the Native Fulltext Search

@tutorial_1254_p
 To initialize, call: 

@tutorial_1255_p
 You need to initialize it in each database where you want to use it. Afterwards, you can create a fulltext index for a table using: 

@tutorial_1256_p
 PUBLIC is the schema name, TEST is the table name. The list of column names (column separated) is optional, in this case all columns are indexed. The index is updated in realtime. To search the index, use the following query: 

@tutorial_1257_p
 This will produce a result set that contains the query needed to retrieve the data: 

@tutorial_1258_p
 To get the raw data, use <code>FT_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0);</code>. The result contains the columns <code>SCHEMA</code> (the schema name), <code>TABLE</code> (the table name), <code>COLUMNS</code> (an array of column names), and <code>KEYS</code> (an array of objects). To join a table, use a join as in: <code>SELECT T.* FROM FT_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0) FT, TEST T WHERE FT.TABLE='TEST' AND T.ID=FT.KEYS[0];</code> 

@tutorial_1259_p
 You can also call the index from within a Java application: 

@tutorial_1260_h3
Using the Lucene Fulltext Search

@tutorial_1261_p
 To use the Lucene full text search, you need the Lucene library in the classpath. How to do that depends on the application; if you use the H2 Console, you can add the Lucene jar file to the environment variables <code>H2DRIVERS</code> or <code>CLASSPATH</code>. To initialize the Lucene fulltext search in a database, call: 

@tutorial_1262_p
 You need to initialize it in each database where you want to use it. Afterwards, you can create a full text index for a table using: 

@tutorial_1263_p
 PUBLIC is the schema name, TEST is the table name. The list of column names (column separated) is optional, in this case all columns are indexed. The index is updated in realtime. To search the index, use the following query: 

@tutorial_1264_p
 This will produce a result set that contains the query needed to retrieve the data: 

@tutorial_1265_p
 To get the raw data, use <code>FTL_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0);</code>. The result contains the columns <code>SCHEMA</code> (the schema name), <code>TABLE</code> (the table name), <code>COLUMNS</code> (an array of column names), and <code>KEYS</code> (an array of objects). To join a table, use a join as in: <code>SELECT T.* FROM FTL_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0) FT, TEST T WHERE FT.TABLE='TEST' AND T.ID=FT.KEYS[0];</code> 

@tutorial_1266_p
 You can also call the index from within a Java application: 

@tutorial_1267_h2
User-Defined Variables

@tutorial_1268_p
 This database supports user-defined variables. Variables start with <code>@</code> and can be used wherever expressions or parameters are allowed. Variables are not persisted and session scoped, that means only visible from within the session in which they are defined. A value is usually assigned using the SET command: 

@tutorial_1269_p
 The value can also be changed using the SET() method. This is useful in queries: 

@tutorial_1270_p
 Variables that are not set evaluate to <code>NULL</code>. The data type of a user-defined variable is the data type of the value assigned to it, that means it is not necessary (or possible) to declare variable names before using them. There are no restrictions on the assigned values; large objects (LOBs) are supported as well. 

@tutorial_1271_h2
Date and Time

@tutorial_1272_p
 Date, time and timestamp values support ISO 8601 formatting, including time zone: 

@tutorial_1273_p
 If the time zone is not set, the value is parsed using the current time zone setting of the system. Date and time information is stored in H2 database files in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). If the database is opened using another system time zone, the date and time will change accordingly. If you want to move a database from one time zone to the other and don't want this to happen, you need to create a SQL script file using the <code>SCRIPT</code> command or <code>Script</code> tool, and then load the database using the <code>RUNSCRIPT</code> command or the <code>RunScript</code> tool in the new time zone. 

@tutorial_1274_h2
Using Spring

@tutorial_1275_p
 Use the following configuration to start and stop the H2 TCP server using the Spring Framework: 

@tutorial_1276_p
 The <code>destroy-method</code> will help prevent exceptions on hot-redeployment or when restarting the server.
