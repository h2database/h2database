Benchmark:

Hi,

If you are running benchmarks, could you profile them please? To do that use java -Xrunhprof:cpu=samples,depth=8 ... - and then upload/post the file java.hprof.txt

If the benchmark application is not a self contained application, another way is to generate 'full thread dumps' (maybe 30 or so) while running the benchmark, and upload them? To get a full thread dump, you can use "kill -QUIT <pid>", or (Windows) press Ctrl+Pause, or (Java 1.6) use jps -l to get the <pid>, and then use jstack <pid>.

Regards,
Thomas

Can not reproduce:

Hi,

Sorry I can not reproduce this problem. Could you post a simple, standalone test case that reproduces the problem? It would be great if the test case does not have any dependencies except the H2 jar file (that is, a simple SQL script that can be run in the H2 Console, or a Java class uses the JDBC API and is run using a static main method). If the test case does have dependencies it would help a lot if you upload them somewhere (for example Rapidshare.com). Please include any initialization code (CREATE TABLE, INSERT and so on) in the Java class or in a .sql script file.

Regards,
Thomas

Defect report:

What steps will reproduce the problem?
(simple SQL scripts or simple standalone applications are preferred)
1.
2.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


What version of the product are you using? On what operating system, file system, and virtual machine?


Do you know a workaround?

How important/urgent is the problem for you?

In your view, is this a defect or a feature request?

Please provide any additional information below.

-----------------

This looks like a serious problem. I have a few questions:

- Could you send the full stack trace of the exception including message text?
- What is your database URL?
- Did you use multiple connections?
- Do you use temporary tables?
- A workarounds is: use the tool org.h2.tools.Recover to create
    the SQL script file, and then re-create the database using this script.
    Does it work when you do this?
- With which version of H2 was this database created?
    You can find it out using:
    select * from information_schema.settings where name='CREATE_BUILD'
    or have a look in the SQL script created by the recover tool.
- Did the application run out of memory (once, or multiple times)?
- Do you use any settings or special features (for example cache settings,
    two phase commit, linked tables)?
- Do you use any H2-specific system properties?
- Is the application multi-threaded?
- What operating system, file system, and virtual machine
    (java -version) do you use?
- How did you start the Java process (java -Xmx... and so on)?
- Is it (or was it at some point) a networked file system?
- How big is the database (file sizes)?
- How much heap memory does the Java process have?
- Is the database usually closed normally, or is process terminated
    forcefully or the computer switched off?
- Is it possible to reproduce this problem using a fresh database
    (sometimes, or always)?
- Are there any other exceptions (maybe in the .trace.db file)?
    Could you send them please?
- Do you still have any .trace.db files, and if yes could you send them?
- Could you send the .h2.db file where this exception occurs?

Corrupted database

I am sorry to say that, but it looks like a corruption problem. I am very interested in analyzing and solving this problem. Corruption problems have top priority for me. I have a few questions:

- Could you send the full stack trace of the exception including message text?
- What is your database URL?
- Do you use Tomcat or another web server?
    Do you unload or reload the web application?
- You can find out if the database is corrupted when running
    SCRIPT TO 'test.sql'
- What version H2 are you using?
- Did you use multiple connections?
- The first workarounds is: append ;RECOVER=1 to the database URL.
    Does it work when you do this?
- The second workarounds is: delete the index.db file (it is re-created
    automatically) and try again. Does it work when you do this?
- The third workarounds is: use the tool org.h2.tools.Recover to create
    the SQL script file, and then re-create the database using this script.
    Does it work when you do this?
- With which version of H2 was this database created?
    You can find it out using:
    select * from information_schema.settings where name='CREATE_BUILD'

- Do you use any settings or special features (for example, the setting

- Is it (or was it at some point) a networked file system?
- How big is the database (file sizes)?
- Is the database usually closed normally, or is process terminated
    forcefully or the computer switched off?
- Is it possible to reproduce this problem using a fresh database
    (sometimes, or always)?
- Are there any other exceptions (maybe in the .trace.db file)?
    Could you send them please?
- Do you still have any .trace.db files, and if yes could you send them?
- Could you send the .data.db file where this exception occurs?
