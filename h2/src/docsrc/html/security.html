<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
H2 is __not__ designed to be run in an adversarial environment. You should absolutely not expose your H2 server to untrusted connections.
</p>
<p>
Running H2 in embedded mode is the best choice - it is not externally exposed.
</p>

<h2 id="network">Network exposed</h2>
<p>
When running an H2 server in TCP mode, first prize is to run with it only listening to connections on localhost (i.e 127.0.0.1).
</p>
<p>
Second prize is running listening to restricted ports on a secured network.
</p>
<p>
If you expose H2 to the broader Internet, you can secure the connection with SSL, but this is a rather tricky thing to get right, between JVM bugs, certificates and choosing a decent cipher.
</p>

<h2 id="alias">Alias / Stored procedures</h2>
<p>
Anything created with <code>CREATE ALIAS</code> can do anything the JVM can do, which includes reading/writing from the filesystem on the machine the JVM is running on.
</p>

<h2 id="roles">Grants / Roles / Permissions</h2>
<p>
<code>GRANT / REVOKE</code> TODO
</p>

<h2 id="encrypted_storage">Encrypted storage</h2>
<p>
Encrypting your on-disk database will provide a small measure of security to your stored data.
You should not assume that this is any kind of real security against a determined opponent however,
since there are many repeated data structures that will allow someone with resources and time to extract the secret key.
</p>
<p>
Also the secret key is visible to anything that can read the memory of the process.
