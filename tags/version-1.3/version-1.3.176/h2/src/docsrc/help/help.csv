","
Selects data from a table or multiple tables.
GROUP BY groups the the result by the given expression(s).
HAVING filter rows after grouping.
ORDER BY sorts the result by the given column(s) or expression(s).
UNION combines the result of this query with the results of another query.

LIMIT limits the number of rows returned by the query (no limit if null or smaller than zero).
OFFSET specified how many rows to skip.
SAMPLE_SIZE limits the number of rows read for aggregate queries.

Multiple set operators (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS, EXPECT) are evaluated
from left to right. For compatibility with other databases and future versions
of H2 please use parentheses.

If FOR UPDATE is specified, the tables are locked for writing. When using
MVCC, only the selected rows are locked as in an UPDATE statement.
In this case, aggregate, GROUP BY, DISTINCT queries or joins
are not allowed in this case.

Inserts a new row / new rows into a table.

When using DIRECT, then the results from the query are directly applied in the target table without any intermediate step.

When using SORTED, b-tree pages are split at the insertion point. This can improve performance and reduce disk usage.

","
Updates existing rows, and insert rows that don't exist. If no key column is
specified, the primary key columns are used to find the row. If more than one
row per new row is affected, an exception is thrown. If the table contains an
auto-incremented key or identity column, and the row was updated, the generated
key is set to 0; otherwise it is set to the new key.

"Commands (DML)","RUNSCRIPT","
RUNSCRIPT FROM fileNameString scriptCompressionEncryption
[ CHARSET charsetString ]
","
Runs a SQL script from a file. The script is a text file containing SQL
statements; each statement must end with ';'. This command can be used to
restore a database from a backup. The password must be in single quotes; it is
case sensitive and can contain spaces.

Instead of a file name, an URL may be used.
To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix 'classpath:'.
See the Pluggable File System section on the Advanced page.

The compression algorithm must match the one used when creating the script.
Instead of a file, an URL may be used.

","
Creates a SQL script from the database.

SIMPLE does not use multi-row insert statements.
NODATA will not emit INSERT statements.
If the DROP option is specified, drop statements are created for tables, views,
and sequences. If the block size is set, CLOB and BLOB values larger than this
size are split into separate blocks.
BLOCKSIZE is used when writing out LOB data, and specifies the point at the
values transition from being inserted as inline values, to be inserted using
out-of-line commands.
NOSETTINGS turns off dumping the database settings (the SET XXX commands)

If no file name is specified, the
script is returned as a result set. This command can be used to create a backup
of the database. For long term storage, it is more portable than copying the
database files.

If a file name is specified, then the whole
script (including insert statements) is written to this file, and a result set
without the insert statements is returned.

The password must be in single quotes; it is case sensitive and can contain spaces.

This command locks objects while it is running.
Admin rights are required to execute this command.

When using the TABLE or SCHEMA option, only the selected table(s) / schema(s) are included.

","
Changes the data type of a column, rename a column,
change the identity value, or change the selectivity.

Changing the data type fails if the data can not be converted.

RESTART changes the next value of an auto increment column.
The column must already be an auto increment column.
For RESTART, the same transactional rules as for ALTER SEQUENCE apply.

SELECTIVITY sets the selectivity (1-100) for a column.
Setting the selectivity to 0 means the default value.
Selectivity is used by the cost based optimizer to calculate the estimated cost of an index.
Selectivity 100 means values are unique, 10 means every distinct value appears 10 times on average.

SET DEFAULT changes the default value of a column.

SET NULL sets a column to allow NULL. The row may not be part of a primary key.
Single column indexes on this column are dropped.

SET NOT NULL sets a column to not allow NULL. Rows may not contains NULL in this column.

Disables or enables referential integrity checking for a table. This command can
be used inside a transaction. Enabling referential integrity does not check
existing data, except if CHECK is specified. Use SET REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY to
disable it for all tables; the global flag and the flag for each table are

","
Creates a new function alias. If this is a ResultSet returning function,
by default the return value is cached in a local temporary file.

NOBUFFER - disables caching of ResultSet return value to temporary file.

DETERMINISTIC - Deterministic functions must always return the same value for the same parameters.

The method name must be the full qualified class and method name,
and may optionally include the parameter classes as in
""java.lang.Integer.parseInt(java.lang.String, int)"". The class and the method
must both be public, and the method must be static. The class must be available
in the classpath of the database engine (when using the server mode,
it must be in the classpath of the server).

When defining a function alias with source code, the Sun ""javac"" is compiler
is used if the file ""tools.jar"" is in the classpath. If not, ""javac"" is run as a separate process.
Only the source code is stored in the database; the class is compiled each time
the database is re-opened. Source code is usually passed
as dollar quoted text to avoid escaping problems. If import statements are used,
then the tag @CODE must be added before the method.

If the method throws an SQLException, it is directly re-thrown to the calling application;
all other exceptions are first converted to a SQLException.

If the first parameter of the Java function is a ""java.sql.Connection"", then a
connection to the database is provided. This connection must not be closed.
If the class contains multiple methods with the given name but different
parameter count, all methods are mapped.

Hash indexes are meant for in-memory databases and memory tables (CREATE MEMORY TABLE).
For other tables, or if the index contains multiple columns, the HASH keyword is ignored.
Hash indexes can only test for equality, and do not support range queries (similar to a hash table).
Non-unique keys are supported.
Spatial indexes are supported only on Geometry columns.

","
Creates a table link to an external table. The driver name may be empty if the
driver is already loaded. If the schema name is not set, only one table with
that name may exist in the target database.

FORCE - Create the LINKED TABLE even if the remote database/table does not exist.

EMIT UPDATES - Usually, for update statements, the old rows are deleted first and then the new
rows are inserted. It is possible to emit update statements (except on
rollback), however in this case multi-row unique key updates may not always
work. Linked tables to the same database share one connection.

READONLY - is set, the remote table may not be updated. This is enforced by H2.

If the connection to the source database is lost, the connection is re-opened
(this is a workaround for MySQL that disconnects after 8 hours of inactivity by default).

If a query is used instead of the original table name, the table is read only.
Queries must be enclosed in parenthesis: ""(SELECT * FROM ORDERS)"".

To use JNDI to get the connection, the driver class must be a
javax.naming.Context (for example ""javax.naming.InitialContext""), and the URL must
be the resource name (for example ""java:comp/env/jdbc/Test"").

Creates a new table.

Cached tables (the default for regular tables) are persistent,
and the number of rows is not limited by the main memory.
Memory tables (the default for temporary tables) are persistent,
but the index data is kept in main memory,
that means memory tables should not get too large.

Temporary tables are deleted when closing or opening a database.
Temporary tables can be global (accessible by all connections)
or local (only accessible by the current connection).
The default for temporary tables is global.
Indexes of temporary tables are kept fully in main memory,
unless the temporary table is created using CREATE CACHED TABLE.

The ENGINE option is only required when custom table implementations are used.
The table engine class must implement the interface ""org.h2.api.TableEngine"".
Any table engine parameters are passed down in the tableEngineParams field of the CreateTableData object.

Tables with the NOT PERSISTENT modifier are kept fully in memory, and all
rows are lost when the database is closed.

The column definition is optional if a query is specified.
In that case the column list of the query is used.

Creates a new trigger.
The trigger class must be public and implement ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
Inner classes are not supported.
The class must be available in the classpath of the database engine
(when using the server mode, it must be in the classpath of the server).

BEFORE triggers are called after data conversion is made, default values are set,
null and length constraint checks have been made;
but before other constraints have been checked.
If there are multiple triggers, the order in which they are called is undefined.

ROLLBACK can be specified in combination with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Only row based AFTER trigger can be called on ROLLBACK.
Exceptions that occur within such triggers are ignored.
As the operations that occur within a trigger are part of the transaction,
ROLLBACK triggers are only required if an operation communicates outside of the database.

INSTEAD OF triggers are implicitly row based and behave like BEFORE triggers.
Only the first such trigger is called. Such triggers on views are supported.
They can be used to make views updatable.

A BEFORE SELECT trigger is fired just before the database engine tries to read from the table.
The trigger can be used to update a table on demand.
The trigger is called with both 'old' and 'new' set to null.

The MERGE statement will call both INSERT and UPDATE triggers.
Not supported are SELECT triggers with the option FOR EACH ROW,
and AFTER SELECT triggers.

Committing or rolling back a transaction within a trigger is not allowed, except for SELECT triggers.

By default a trigger is called once for each statement, without the old and new rows.
FOR EACH ROW triggers are called once for each inserted, updated, or deleted row.

QUEUE is implemented for syntax compatibility with HSQL and has no effect.

"Commands (Other)","SET LOG","
SET LOG int
","
Sets the transaction log mode. The values 0, 1, and 2 are supported, the default is 2.
This setting affects all connections.

LOG 0 means the transaction log is disabled completely. It is the fastest mode,
but also the most dangerous: if the process is killed while the database is open in this mode,
the data might be lost. It must only be used if this is not a problem, for example when
initially loading a database, or when running tests.

LOG 1 means the transaction log is enabled, but FileDescriptor.sync is disabled.
This setting is about half as fast as with LOG 0. This setting is useful if no protection
against power failure is required, but the data must be protected against killing the process.

LOG 2 (the default) means the transaction log is enabled, and FileDescriptor.sync is called
for each checkpoint. This setting is about half as fast as LOG 1. Depending on the
file system, this will also protect against power failure in the majority if cases.

The value 0 means no locking (should only be used for testing; also known as
READ_UNCOMMITTED). Please note that using SET LOCK_MODE 0 while at the same time
using multiple connections may result in inconsistent transactions.

The value 1 means table level locking (also known as SERIALIZABLE).

The value 2 means table level locking with garbage collection (if the
application does not close all connections).

Default expressions are used if no explicit value was used when adding a row.
The computed column expression is evaluated and assigned whenever the row changes.

Identity and auto-increment columns are columns with a sequence as the
default. The column declared as the identity columns is implicitly the
primary key column of this table (unlike auto-increment columns).

The options PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK are not supported for ALTER statements.

Check constraints can reference columns of the table,
and they can reference objects that exist while the statement is executed.
Conditions are only checked when a row is added or modified
in the table where the constraint exists.

    | IN ( { select | expression [,...] } )
    | [ NOT ] LIKE operand [ ESCAPE string ]
    | [ NOT ] REGEXP operand
","
The right hand side of a condition.

The conditions ""IS [ NOT ]"" and ""IS [ NOT ] DISTINCT FROM"" are null-safe, meaning
NULL is considered the same as NULL, and the condition never evaluates to NULL.

When comparing with LIKE, the wildcards characters are ""_"" (any one character)
and ""%"" (any characters). The database uses an index when comparing with LIKE
except if the operand starts with a wildcard. To search for the characters ""%"" and
""_"", the characters need to be escaped. The default escape character is "" \ "" (backslash).
To select no escape character, use ""ESCAPE ''"" (empty string).
At most one escape character is allowed.
Each character that follows the escape character in the pattern needs to match exactly.
Patterns that end with an escape character are invalid and the expression returns NULL.

When comparing with REGEXP, regular expression matching is used.
See Java ""Matcher.find"" for details.

Optional parameters for CSVREAD and CSVWRITE.
Instead of setting the options one by one, all options can be
combined into a space separated key-value pairs, as follows:
""STRINGDECODE('charset=UTF-8 escape=\"" fieldDelimiter=\"" fieldSeparator=, ' ||""
""'lineComment=# lineSeparator=\n null= rowSeparator=')"".
The following options are supported:

""caseSensitiveColumnNames"" (true or false; disabled by default),

""charset"",

""escape"",

""fieldDelimiter"",

""fieldSeparator"",

""lineComment"" (disabled by default),

""lineSeparator"",

""null"", Note that an empty value is always treated as null.
This feature for compatibility, it is only here to support reading existing CSV files
that contain explicit ""null"" delimiters.

""rowSeparator"" (not set by default),

""preserveWhitespace"" (true or false; disabled by default),

""writeColumnHeader"" (true or false; enabled by default).

For a newline or other special character, use STRINGDECODE as in the example above.
A space needs to be escaped with a backslash (""'\ '""), and
a backslash needs to be escaped with another backslash (""'\\'"").
All other characters are not to be escaped, that means
newline and tab characters are written as such.

CLOB should be used for documents and texts with arbitrary size such as XML or
HTML documents, text files, or memo fields of unlimited size. Use
""PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream"" to store values. See also Advanced / Large Objects.

VARCHAR should be used for text with relatively short average size (for example
shorter than 200 characters). Short CLOB values are stored inline, but there is
an overhead compared to VARCHAR.

""ResultSet.getObject"" will return a ""java.util.UUID"".

Please note that using an index on randomly generated data will
result on poor performance once there are millions of rows in a table.

"Functions (System)","CSVREAD","
CSVREAD(fileNameString [, columnsString [, csvOptions ] ] )
","
Returns the result set of reading the CSV (comma separated values) file.
For each parameter, NULL means the default value should be used.

If the column names are specified (a list of column names separated with the
fieldSeparator), those are used, otherwise (or if they are set to NULL) the first line of
the file is interpreted as the column names.
In that case, column names that contain no special characters (only letters, '_',
and digits; similar to the rule for Java identifiers) are considered case insensitive.
Other column names are case sensitive, that means you need to use quoted identifiers
(see below).

The default charset is the default value for this system, and the default field separator
is a comma. Missing unquoted values as well as data that matches nullString is
parsed as NULL. All columns of type VARCHAR.

The BOM (the byte-order-mark) character 0xfeff at the beginning of the file is ignored.

This function can be used like a table: ""SELECT * FROM CSVREAD(...)"".

Instead of a file, an URL may be used, for example
""jar:file:///c:/temp/example.zip!/org/example/nested.csv"".
To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix ""classpath:"".
To read from HTTP, use the prefix ""http:"" (as in a browser).

For performance reason, CSVREAD should not be used inside a join.
Instead, import the data first (possibly into a temporary table) and then use the table.

Admin rights are required to execute this command.

","
Writes a CSV (comma separated values). The file is overwritten if it exists.
If only a file name is specified, it will be written to the current working directory.
For each parameter, NULL means the default value should be used.
The default charset is the default value for this system, and the default field separator is a comma.

The values are converted to text using the default string representation;
if another conversion is required you need to change the select statement accordingly.
The parameter nullString is used when writing NULL (by default nothing is written
when NULL appears). The default line separator is the default value for this
system (system property ""line.separator"").

The returned value is the number or rows written.
Admin rights are required to execute this command.

"

"Functions (System)","TRUNCATE_VALUE","
TRUNCATE_VALUE(value, precisionInt, forceBoolean)
","
Truncate a value to the required precision.
The precision of the returned value may be a bit larger than requested,
because fixed precision values are not truncated (unlike the numeric TRUNCATE method).
Unlike CAST, the truncating a decimal value may lose precision if the force flag is set to true.
The method returns a value with the same data type as the first parameter.
