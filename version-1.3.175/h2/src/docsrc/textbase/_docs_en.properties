advanced_1036_h2=Result Sets
advanced_1037_h3=Statements that Return a Result Set
advanced_1038_p=\ The following statements return a result set\: <code>SELECT, EXPLAIN, CALL, SCRIPT, SHOW, HELP</code>. All other statements return an update count. 
advanced_1039_h3=Limiting the Number of Rows
advanced_1040_p=\ Before the result is returned to the application, all rows are read by the database. Server side cursors are not supported currently. If only the first few rows are interesting for the application, then the result set size should be limited to improve the performance. This can be done using <code>LIMIT</code> in a query (example\: <code>SELECT * FROM TEST LIMIT 100</code>), or by using <code>Statement.setMaxRows(max)</code>. 
advanced_1041_h3=Large Result Sets and External Sorting
advanced_1042_p=\ For large result set, the result is buffered to disk. The threshold can be defined using the statement <code>SET MAX_MEMORY_ROWS</code>. If <code>ORDER BY</code> is used, the sorting is done using an external sort algorithm. In this case, each block of rows is sorted using quick sort, then written to disk; when reading the data, the blocks are merged together. 
advanced_1043_h2=Large Objects
advanced_1044_h3=Storing and Reading Large Objects
advanced_1045_p=\ If it is possible that the objects don't fit into memory, then the data type CLOB (for textual data) or BLOB (for binary data) should be used. For these data types, the objects are not fully read into memory, by using streams. To store a BLOB, use <code>PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream</code>. To store a CLOB, use <code>PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream</code>. To read a BLOB, use <code>ResultSet.getBinaryStream</code>, and to read a CLOB, use <code>ResultSet.getCharacterStream</code>. When using the client/server mode, large BLOB and CLOB data is stored in a temporary file on the client side. 
advanced_1046_h3=When to use CLOB/BLOB
advanced_1047_p=\ By default, this database stores large LOB (CLOB and BLOB) objects separate from the main table data. Small LOB objects are stored in-place, the threshold can be set using <a href\="grammar.html\#set_max_length_inplace_lob" class\="notranslate" >MAX_LENGTH_INPLACE_LOB</a>, but there is still an overhead to use CLOB/BLOB. Because of this, BLOB and CLOB should never be used for columns with a maximum size below about 200 bytes. The best threshold depends on the use case; reading in-place objects is faster than reading from separate files, but slows down the performance of operations that don't involve this column. 
advanced_1048_p=\ It is possible to configure the database to store LOB objects outside the database file, see the <a href\="../javadoc/org/h2/constant/SysProperties.html\#h2.lobInDatabase">h2.lobInDatabase</a> property. 
advanced_1049_h3=Large Object Compression
advanced_1050_p=\ CLOB and BLOB values can be compressed by using <a href\="grammar.html\#set_compress_lob" class\="notranslate" >SET COMPRESS_LOB</a>. The LZF algorithm is faster but needs more disk space. By default compression is disabled, which usually speeds up write operations. If you store many large compressible values such as XML, HTML, text, and uncompressed binary files, then compressing can save a lot of disk space (sometimes more than 50%), and read operations may even be faster. 
advanced_1051_h2=Linked Tables
advanced_1052_p=\ This database supports linked tables, which means tables that don't exist in the current database but are just links to another database. To create such a link, use the <code>CREATE LINKED TABLE</code> statement\: 
advanced_1053_p=\ You can then access the table in the usual way. Whenever the linked table is accessed, the database issues specific queries over JDBC. Using the example above, if you issue the query <code>SELECT * FROM LINK WHERE ID\=1</code>, then the following query is run against the PostgreSQL database\: <code>SELECT * FROM TEST WHERE ID\=?</code>. The same happens for insert and update statements. Only simple statements are executed against the target database, that means no joins. Prepared statements are used where possible. 
advanced_1054_p=\ To view the statements that are executed against the target table, set the trace level to 3. 
advanced_1055_p=\ If multiple linked tables point to the same database (using the same database URL), the connection is shared. To disable this, set the system property <code>h2.shareLinkedConnections\=false</code>. 
advanced_1056_p=\ The statement <a href\="grammar.html\#create_linked_table" class\="notranslate" >CREATE LINKED TABLE</a> supports an optional schema name parameter. 
advanced_1057_p=\ The following are not supported because they may result in a deadlock\: creating a linked table to the same database, and creating a linked table to another database using the server mode if the other database is open in the same server (use the embedded mode instead). 
advanced_1058_p=\ Data types that are not supported in H2 are also not supported for linked tables, for example unsigned data types if the value is outside the range of the signed type. In such cases, the columns needs to be cast to a supported type. 
advanced_1059_h2=Updatable Views
advanced_1060_p=\ By default, views are not updatable. To make a view updatable, use an "instead of" trigger as follows\: 
advanced_1061_p=\ Update the base table(s) within the trigger as required. For details, see the sample application <code>org.h2.samples.UpdatableView</code>. 
advanced_1062_h2=Transaction Isolation
advanced_1063_p=\ Transaction isolation is provided for all data manipulation language (DML) statements. Most data definition language (DDL) statements commit the current transaction. See the <a href\="grammar.html">Grammar</a> for details. 
advanced_1064_p=\ This database supports the following transaction isolation levels\: 
advanced_1065_b=Read Committed
advanced_1066_li=\ This is the default level. Read locks are released immediately after executing the statement, but write locks are kept until the transaction commits. Higher concurrency is possible when using this level.
advanced_1067_li=\ To enable, execute the SQL statement <code>SET LOCK_MODE 3</code>
advanced_1068_li=\ or append <code>;LOCK_MODE\=3</code> to the database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;LOCK_MODE\=3</code> 
advanced_1069_b=Serializable
advanced_1070_li=\ Both read locks and write locks are kept until the transaction commits. To enable, execute the SQL statement <code>SET LOCK_MODE 1</code>
advanced_1071_li=\ or append <code>;LOCK_MODE\=1</code> to the database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;LOCK_MODE\=1</code> 
advanced_1072_b=Read Uncommitted
advanced_1073_li=\ This level means that transaction isolation is disabled.
advanced_1074_li=\ To enable, execute the SQL statement <code>SET LOCK_MODE 0</code>
advanced_1075_li=\ or append <code>;LOCK_MODE\=0</code> to the database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;LOCK_MODE\=0</code> 
advanced_1076_p=\ When using the isolation level 'serializable', dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads are prohibited. 
advanced_1077_b=Dirty Reads
advanced_1078_li=\ Means a connection can read uncommitted changes made by another connection.
advanced_1079_li=\ Possible with\: read uncommitted 
advanced_1080_b=Non-Repeatable Reads
advanced_1081_li=\ A connection reads a row, another connection changes a row and commits, and the first connection re-reads the same row and gets the new result.
advanced_1082_li=\ Possible with\: read uncommitted, read committed 
advanced_1083_b=Phantom Reads
advanced_1084_li=\ A connection reads a set of rows using a condition, another connection inserts a row that falls in this condition and commits, then the first connection re-reads using the same condition and gets the new row.
advanced_1085_li=\ Possible with\: read uncommitted, read committed 
advanced_1086_h3=Table Level Locking
advanced_1087_p=\ The database allows multiple concurrent connections to the same database. To make sure all connections only see consistent data, table level locking is used by default. This mechanism does not allow high concurrency, but is very fast. Shared locks and exclusive locks are supported. Before reading from a table, the database tries to add a shared lock to the table (this is only possible if there is no exclusive lock on the object by another connection). If the shared lock is added successfully, the table can be read. It is allowed that other connections also have a shared lock on the same object. If a connection wants to write to a table (update or delete a row), an exclusive lock is required. To get the exclusive lock, other connection must not have any locks on the object. After the connection commits, all locks are released. This database keeps all locks in memory. When a lock is released, and multiple connections are waiting for it, one of them is picked at random. 
advanced_1088_h3=Lock Timeout
advanced_1089_p=\ If a connection cannot get a lock on an object, the connection waits for some amount of time (the lock timeout). During this time, hopefully the connection holding the lock commits and it is then possible to get the lock. If this is not possible because the other connection does not release the lock for some time, the unsuccessful connection will get a lock timeout exception. The lock timeout can be set individually for each connection. 
advanced_1090_h2=Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
advanced_1091_p=\ The MVCC feature allows higher concurrency than using (table level or row level) locks. When using MVCC in this database, delete, insert and update operations will only issue a shared lock on the table. An exclusive lock is still used when adding or removing columns, when dropping the table, and when using <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>. Connections only 'see' committed data, and own changes. That means, if connection A updates a row but doesn't commit this change yet, connection B will see the old value. Only when the change is committed, the new value is visible by other connections (read committed). If multiple connections concurrently try to update the same row, the database waits until it can apply the change, but at most until the lock timeout expires. 
advanced_1092_p=\ To use the MVCC feature, append <code>;MVCC\=TRUE</code> to the database URL\: 
advanced_1093_p=\ MVCC is disabled by default. The MVCC feature is not fully tested yet. The limitations of the MVCC mode are\: it can not be used at the same time as <code>MULTI_THREADED\=TRUE</code>; the complete undo log (the list of uncommitted changes) must fit in memory when using multi-version concurrency. The setting <code>MAX_MEMORY_UNDO</code> has no effect. It is not possible to enable or disable this setting while the database is already open. The setting must be specified in the first connection (the one that opens the database). 
advanced_1094_p=\ If MVCC is enabled, changing the lock mode (<code>LOCK_MODE</code>) has no effect. 
advanced_1095_h2=Clustering / High Availability
advanced_1096_p=\ This database supports a simple clustering / high availability mechanism. The architecture is\: two database servers run on two different computers, and on both computers is a copy of the same database. If both servers run, each database operation is executed on both computers. If one server fails (power, hardware or network failure), the other server can still continue to work. From this point on, the operations will be executed only on one server until the other server is back up. 
advanced_1097_p=\ Clustering can only be used in the server mode (the embedded mode does not support clustering). The cluster can be re-created using the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool without stopping the remaining server. Applications that are still connected are automatically disconnected, however when appending <code>;AUTO_RECONNECT\=TRUE</code>, they will recover from that. 
advanced_1098_p=\ To initialize the cluster, use the following steps\: 
advanced_1099_li=Create a database 
advanced_1100_li=Use the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool to copy the database to another location and initialize the clustering. Afterwards, you have two databases containing the same data. 
advanced_1101_li=Start two servers (one for each copy of the database) 
advanced_1102_li=You are now ready to connect to the databases with the client application(s) 
advanced_1103_h3=Using the CreateCluster Tool
advanced_1104_p=\ To understand how clustering works, please try out the following example. In this example, the two databases reside on the same computer, but usually, the databases will be on different servers. 
advanced_1105_li=Create two directories\: <code>server1, server2</code>. Each directory will simulate a directory on a computer. 
advanced_1106_li=Start a TCP server pointing to the first directory. You can do this using the command line\: 
advanced_1107_li=Start a second TCP server pointing to the second directory. This will simulate a server running on a second (redundant) computer. You can do this using the command line\: 
advanced_1108_li=Use the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool to initialize clustering. This will automatically create a new, empty database if it does not exist. Run the tool on the command line\: 
advanced_1109_li=You can now connect to the databases using an application or the H2 Console using the JDBC URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost\:9101,localhost\:9102/~/test</code> 
advanced_1110_li=If you stop a server (by killing the process), you will notice that the other machine continues to work, and therefore the database is still accessible. 
advanced_1111_li=To restore the cluster, you first need to delete the database that failed, then restart the server that was stopped, and re-run the <code>CreateCluster</code> tool. 
advanced_1112_h3=Detect Which Cluster Instances are Running
advanced_1113_p=\ To find out which cluster nodes are currently running, execute the following SQL statement\: 
advanced_1114_p=\ If the result is <code>''</code> (two single quotes), then the cluster mode is disabled. Otherwise, the list of servers is returned, enclosed in single quote. Example\: <code>'server1\:9191,server2\:9191'</code>. 
advanced_1115_h3=Clustering Algorithm and Limitations
advanced_1116_p=\ Read-only queries are only executed against the first cluster node, but all other statements are executed against all nodes. There is currently no load balancing made to avoid problems with transactions. The following functions may yield different results on different cluster nodes and must be executed with care\: <code>RANDOM_UUID(), SECURE_RAND(), SESSION_ID(), MEMORY_FREE(), MEMORY_USED(), CSVREAD(), CSVWRITE(), RAND()</code> [when not using a seed]. Those functions should not be used directly in modifying statements (for example <code>INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE</code>). However, they can be used in read-only statements and the result can then be used for modifying statements. Using auto-increment and identity columns is currently not supported. Instead, sequence values need to be manually requested and then used to insert data (using two statements). 
advanced_1117_p=\ When using the cluster modes, result sets are read fully in memory by the client, so that there is no problem if the server dies that executed the query. Result sets must fit in memory on the client side. 
advanced_1118_p=\ The SQL statement <code>SET AUTOCOMMIT FALSE</code> is not supported in the cluster mode. To disable autocommit, the method <code>Connection.setAutoCommit(false)</code> needs to be called. 
advanced_1119_p=\ It is possible that a transaction from one connection overtakes a transaction from a different connection. Depending on the operations, this might result in different results, for example when conditionally incrementing a value in a row. 
advanced_1120_h2=Two Phase Commit
advanced_1121_p=\ The two phase commit protocol is supported. 2-phase-commit works as follows\: 
advanced_1122_li=Autocommit needs to be switched off 
advanced_1123_li=A transaction is started, for example by inserting a row 
advanced_1124_li=The transaction is marked 'prepared' by executing the SQL statement <code>PREPARE COMMIT transactionName</code> 
advanced_1125_li=The transaction can now be committed or rolled back 
advanced_1126_li=If a problem occurs before the transaction was successfully committed or rolled back (for example because a network problem occurred), the transaction is in the state 'in-doubt' 
advanced_1127_li=When re-connecting to the database, the in-doubt transactions can be listed with <code>SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.IN_DOUBT</code> 
advanced_1128_li=Each transaction in this list must now be committed or rolled back by executing <code>COMMIT TRANSACTION transactionName</code> or <code>ROLLBACK TRANSACTION transactionName</code> 
advanced_1129_li=The database needs to be closed and re-opened to apply the changes 
advanced_1130_h2=Compatibility
advanced_1131_p=\ This database is (up to a certain point) compatible to other databases such as HSQLDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL. There are certain areas where H2 is incompatible. 
advanced_1132_h3=Transaction Commit when Autocommit is On
advanced_1133_p=\ At this time, this database engine commits a transaction (if autocommit is switched on) just before returning the result. For a query, this means the transaction is committed even before the application scans through the result set, and before the result set is closed. Other database engines may commit the transaction in this case when the result set is closed. 
advanced_1134_h3=Keywords / Reserved Words
advanced_1135_p=\ There is a list of keywords that can't be used as identifiers (table names, column names and so on), unless they are quoted (surrounded with double quotes). The list is currently\: 
advanced_1136_code=\ CROSS, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DISTINCT, EXCEPT, EXISTS, FALSE, FOR, FROM, FULL, GROUP, HAVING, INNER, INTERSECT, IS, JOIN, LIKE, LIMIT, MINUS, NATURAL, NOT, NULL, ON, ORDER, PRIMARY, ROWNUM, SELECT, SYSDATE, SYSTIME, SYSTIMESTAMP, TODAY, TRUE, UNION, UNIQUE, WHERE 
advanced_1137_p=\ Certain words of this list are keywords because they are functions that can be used without '()' for compatibility, for example <code>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</code>. 
advanced_1138_h2=Standards Compliance
advanced_1139_p=\ This database tries to be as much standard compliant as possible. For the SQL language, ANSI/ISO is the main standard. There are several versions that refer to the release date\: SQL-92, SQL\:1999, and SQL\:2003. Unfortunately, the standard documentation is not freely available. Another problem is that important features are not standardized. Whenever this is the case, this database tries to be compatible to other databases. 
advanced_1140_h3=Supported Character Sets, Character Encoding, and Unicode
advanced_1141_p=\ H2 internally uses Unicode, and supports all character encoding systems and character sets supported by the virtual machine you use. 
advanced_1142_h2=Run as Windows Service
advanced_1143_p=\ Using a native wrapper / adapter, Java applications can be run as a Windows Service. There are various tools available to do that. The Java Service Wrapper from <a href\="http\://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org">Tanuki Software, Inc.</a> is included in the installation. Batch files are provided to install, start, stop and uninstall the H2 Database Engine Service. This service contains the TCP Server and the H2 Console web application. The batch files are located in the directory <code>h2/service</code>. 
advanced_1144_p=\ The service wrapper bundled with H2 is a 32-bit version. To use a 64-bit version of Windows (x64), you need to use a 64-bit version of the wrapper, for example the one from <a href\="http\://www.krenger.ch/blog/java-service-wrapper-3-5-14-for-windows-x64/"> Simon Krenger</a>. 
advanced_1145_p=\ When running the database as a service, absolute path should be used. Using <code>~</code> in the database URL is problematic in this case, because it means to use the home directory of the current user. The service might run without or with the wrong user, so that the database files might end up in an unexpected place. 
advanced_1146_h3=Install the Service
advanced_1147_p=\ The service needs to be registered as a Windows Service first. To do that, double click on <code>1_install_service.bat</code>. If successful, a command prompt window will pop up and disappear immediately. If not, a message will appear. 
advanced_1148_h3=Start the Service
advanced_1149_p=\ You can start the H2 Database Engine Service using the service manager of Windows, or by double clicking on <code>2_start_service.bat</code>. Please note that the batch file does not print an error message if the service is not installed. 
advanced_1150_h3=Connect to the H2 Console
advanced_1151_p=\ After installing and starting the service, you can connect to the H2 Console application using a browser. Double clicking on <code>3_start_browser.bat</code> to do that. The default port (8082) is hard coded in the batch file. 
advanced_1152_h3=Stop the Service
advanced_1153_p=\ To stop the service, double click on <code>4_stop_service.bat</code>. Please note that the batch file does not print an error message if the service is not installed or started. 
advanced_1154_h3=Uninstall the Service
advanced_1155_p=\ To uninstall the service, double click on <code>5_uninstall_service.bat</code>. If successful, a command prompt window will pop up and disappear immediately. If not, a message will appear. 
advanced_1156_h3=Additional JDBC drivers
advanced_1157_p=\ To use other databases (for example MySQL), the location of the JDBC drivers of those databases need to be added to the environment variables <code>H2DRIVERS</code> or <code>CLASSPATH</code> before installing the service. Multiple drivers can be set; each entry needs to be separated with a <code>;</code> (Windows) or <code>\:</code> (other operating systems). Spaces in the path names are supported. The settings must not be quoted. 
advanced_1158_h2=ODBC Driver
advanced_1159_p=\ This database does not come with its own ODBC driver at this time, but it supports the PostgreSQL network protocol. Therefore, the PostgreSQL ODBC driver can be used. Support for the PostgreSQL network protocol is quite new and should be viewed as experimental. It should not be used for production applications. 
advanced_1160_p=\ To use the PostgreSQL ODBC driver on 64 bit versions of Windows, first run <code>c\:/windows/syswow64/odbcad32.exe</code>. At this point you set up your DSN just like you would on any other system. See also\: <a href\="http\://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-odbc/2005-09/msg00125.php">Re\: ODBC Driver on Windows 64 bit</a> 
advanced_1161_h3=ODBC Installation
advanced_1162_p=\ First, the ODBC driver must be installed. Any recent PostgreSQL ODBC driver should work, however version 8.2 (<code>psqlodbc-08_02*</code>) or newer is recommended. The Windows version of the PostgreSQL ODBC driver is available at <a href\="http\://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi">http\://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi</a>. 
advanced_1163_h3=Starting the Server
advanced_1164_p=\ After installing the ODBC driver, start the H2 Server using the command line\: 
advanced_1165_p=\ The PG Server (PG for PostgreSQL protocol) is started as well. By default, databases are stored in the current working directory where the server is started. Use <code>-baseDir</code> to save databases in another directory, for example the user home directory\: 
advanced_1166_p=\ The PG server can be started and stopped from within a Java application as follows\: 
advanced_1167_p=\ By default, only connections from localhost are allowed. To allow remote connections, use <code>-pgAllowOthers</code> when starting the server. 
advanced_1168_p=\ To map an ODBC database name to a different JDBC database name, use the option <code>-key</code> when starting the server. Please note only one mapping is allowed. The following will map the ODBC database named <code>TEST</code> to the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/data/test;cipher\=aes</code>\: 
advanced_1169_h3=ODBC Configuration
advanced_1170_p=\ After installing the driver, a new Data Source must be added. In Windows, run <code>odbcad32.exe</code> to open the Data Source Administrator. Then click on 'Add...' and select the PostgreSQL Unicode driver. Then click 'Finish'. You will be able to change the connection properties. The property column represents the property key in the <code>odbc.ini</code> file (which may be different from the GUI).

advanced_1197_p=\ Afterwards, you may use this data source. 
advanced_1198_h3=PG Protocol Support Limitations
advanced_1199_p=\ At this time, only a subset of the PostgreSQL network protocol is implemented. Also, there may be compatibility problems on the SQL level, with the catalog, or with text encoding. Problems are fixed as they are found. Currently, statements can not be canceled when using the PG protocol. Also, H2 does not provide index meta over ODBC. 
advanced_1200_p=\ PostgreSQL ODBC Driver Setup requires a database password; that means it is not possible to connect to H2 databases without password. This is a limitation of the ODBC driver. 
advanced_1201_h3=Security Considerations
advanced_1202_p=\ Currently, the PG Server does not support challenge response or encrypt passwords. This may be a problem if an attacker can listen to the data transferred between the ODBC driver and the server, because the password is readable to the attacker. Also, it is currently not possible to use encrypted SSL connections. Therefore the ODBC driver should not be used where security is important. 
advanced_1203_p=\ The first connection that opens a database using the PostgreSQL server needs to be an administrator user. Subsequent connections don't need to be opened by an administrator. 
advanced_1204_h3=Using Microsoft Access
advanced_1205_p=\ When using Microsoft Access to edit data in a linked H2 table, you may need to enable the following option\: Tools - Options - Edit/Find - ODBC fields. 
advanced_1206_h2=Using H2 in Microsoft .NET
advanced_1207_p=\ The database can be used from Microsoft .NET even without using Java, by using IKVM.NET. You can access a H2 database on .NET using the JDBC API, or using the ADO.NET interface. 
advanced_1208_h3=Using the ADO.NET API on .NET
advanced_1209_p=\ An implementation of the ADO.NET interface is available in the open source project <a href\="http\://code.google.com/p/h2sharp">H2Sharp</a>. 
advanced_1210_h3=Using the JDBC API on .NET
advanced_1211_li=Install the .NET Framework from <a href\="http\://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. Mono has not yet been tested. 
advanced_1212_li=Install <a href\="http\://www.ikvm.net">IKVM.NET</a>. 
advanced_1213_li=Copy the <code>h2*.jar</code> file to <code>ikvm/bin</code> 
advanced_1214_li=Run the H2 Console using\: <code>ikvm -jar h2*.jar</code> 
advanced_1215_li=Convert the H2 Console to an <code>.exe</code> file using\: <code>ikvmc -target\:winexe h2*.jar</code>. You may ignore the warnings. 
advanced_1216_li=Create a <code>.dll</code> file using (change the version accordingly)\: <code>ikvmc.exe -target\:library -version\:1.0.69.0 h2*.jar</code> 
advanced_1217_p=\ If you want your C\# application use H2, you need to add the <code>h2.dll</code> and the <code>IKVM.OpenJDK.ClassLibrary.dll</code> to your C\# solution. Here some sample code\: 
advanced_1218_h2=ACID
advanced_1219_p=\ In the database world, ACID stands for\: 
advanced_1220_li=Atomicity\: transactions must be atomic, meaning either all tasks are performed or none. 
advanced_1221_li=Consistency\: all operations must comply with the defined constraints. 
advanced_1222_li=Isolation\: transactions must be isolated from each other. 
advanced_1223_li=Durability\: committed transaction will not be lost. 
advanced_1224_h3=Atomicity
advanced_1225_p=\ Transactions in this database are always atomic. 
advanced_1226_h3=Consistency
advanced_1227_p=\ By default, this database is always in a consistent state. Referential integrity rules are enforced except when explicitly disabled. 
advanced_1228_h3=Isolation
advanced_1229_p=\ For H2, as with most other database systems, the default isolation level is 'read committed'. This provides better performance, but also means that transactions are not completely isolated. H2 supports the transaction isolation levels 'serializable', 'read committed', and 'read uncommitted'. 
advanced_1230_h3=Durability
advanced_1231_p=\ This database does not guarantee that all committed transactions survive a power failure. Tests show that all databases sometimes lose transactions on power failure (for details, see below). Where losing transactions is not acceptable, a laptop or UPS (uninterruptible power supply) should be used. If durability is required for all possible cases of hardware failure, clustering should be used, such as the H2 clustering mode. 
advanced_1232_h2=Durability Problems
advanced_1233_p=\ Complete durability means all committed transaction survive a power failure. Some databases claim they can guarantee durability, but such claims are wrong. A durability test was run against H2, HSQLDB, PostgreSQL, and Derby. All of those databases sometimes lose committed transactions. The test is included in the H2 download, see <code>org.h2.test.poweroff.Test</code>. 
advanced_1234_h3=Ways to (Not) Achieve Durability
advanced_1235_p=\ Making sure that committed transactions are not lost is more complicated than it seems first. To guarantee complete durability, a database must ensure that the log record is on the hard drive before the commit call returns. To do that, databases use different methods. One is to use the 'synchronous write' file access mode. In Java, <code>RandomAccessFile</code> supports the modes <code>rws</code> and <code>rwd</code>\: 
advanced_1236_code=rwd
advanced_1237_li=\: every update to the file's content is written synchronously to the underlying storage device. 
advanced_1238_code=rws
advanced_1239_li=\: in addition to <code>rwd</code>, every update to the metadata is written synchronously.
advanced_1240_p=\ A test (<code>org.h2.test.poweroff.TestWrite</code>) with one of those modes achieves around 50 thousand write operations per second. Even when the operating system write buffer is disabled, the write rate is around 50 thousand operations per second. This feature does not force changes to disk because it does not flush all buffers. The test updates the same byte in the file again and again. If the hard drive was able to write at this rate, then the disk would need to make at least 50 thousand revolutions per second, or 3 million RPM (revolutions per minute). There are no such hard drives. The hard drive used for the test is about 7200 RPM, or about 120 revolutions per second. There is an overhead, so the maximum write rate must be lower than that. 
advanced_1241_p=\ Calling <code>fsync</code> flushes the buffers. There are two ways to do that in Java\: 
advanced_1242_code=FileDescriptor.sync()
advanced_1243_li=. The documentation says that this forces all system buffers to synchronize with the underlying device. This method is supposed to return after all in-memory modified copies of buffers associated with this file descriptor have been written to the physical medium. 
advanced_1244_code=FileChannel.force()
advanced_1245_li=. This method is supposed to force any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage device that contains it. 
advanced_1246_p=\ By default, MySQL calls <code>fsync</code> for each commit. When using one of those methods, only around 60 write operations per second can be achieved, which is consistent with the RPM rate of the hard drive used. Unfortunately, even when calling <code>FileDescriptor.sync()</code> or <code>FileChannel.force()</code>, data is not always persisted to the hard drive, because most hard drives do not obey <code>fsync()</code>\: see <a href\="http\://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid\=05/05/13/0529252">Your Hard Drive Lies to You</a>. In Mac OS X, <code>fsync</code> does not flush hard drive buffers. See <a href\="http\://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg00072.html">Bad fsync?</a>. So the situation is confusing, and tests prove there is a problem. 
advanced_1247_p=\ Trying to flush hard drive buffers is hard, and if you do the performance is very bad. First you need to make sure that the hard drive actually flushes all buffers. Tests show that this can not be done in a reliable way. Then the maximum number of transactions is around 60 per second. Because of those reasons, the default behavior of H2 is to delay writing committed transactions. 
advanced_1248_p=\ In H2, after a power failure, a bit more than one second of committed transactions may be lost. To change the behavior, use <code>SET WRITE_DELAY</code> and <code>CHECKPOINT SYNC</code>. Most other databases support commit delay as well. In the performance comparison, commit delay was used for all databases that support it. 
advanced_1249_h3=Running the Durability Test
advanced_1250_p=\ To test the durability / non-durability of this and other databases, you can use the test application in the package <code>org.h2.test.poweroff</code>. Two computers with network connection are required to run this test. One computer just listens, while the test application is run (and power is cut) on the other computer. The computer with the listener application opens a TCP/IP port and listens for an incoming connection. The second computer first connects to the listener, and then created the databases and starts inserting records. The connection is set to 'autocommit', which means after each inserted record a commit is performed automatically. Afterwards, the test computer notifies the listener that this record was inserted successfully. The listener computer displays the last inserted record number every 10 seconds. Now, switch off the power manually, then restart the computer, and run the application again. You will find out that in most cases, none of the databases contains all the records that the listener computer knows about. For details, please consult the source code of the listener and test application. 
advanced_1251_h2=Using the Recover Tool
advanced_1252_p=\ The <code>Recover</code> tool can be used to extract the contents of a database file, even if the database is corrupted. It also extracts the content of the transaction log and large objects (CLOB or BLOB). To run the tool, type on the command line\: 
advanced_1253_p=\ For each database in the current directory, a text file will be created. This file contains raw insert statements (for the data) and data definition (DDL) statements to recreate the schema of the database. This file can be executed using the <code>RunScript</code> tool or a <code>RUNSCRIPT FROM</code> SQL statement. The script includes at least one <code>CREATE USER</code> statement. If you run the script against a database that was created with the same user, or if there are conflicting users, running the script will fail. Consider running the script against a database that was created with a user name that is not in the script. 
advanced_1254_p=\ The <code>Recover</code> tool creates a SQL script from database file. It also processes the transaction log. 
advanced_1255_p=\ To verify the database can recover at any time, append <code>;RECOVER_TEST\=64</code> to the database URL in your test environment. This will simulate an application crash after each 64 writes to the database file. A log file named <code>databaseName.h2.db.log</code> is created that lists the operations. The recovery is tested using an in-memory file system, that means it may require a larger heap setting. 
advanced_1256_h2=File Locking Protocols
advanced_1257_p=\ Multiple concurrent connections to the same database are supported, however a database file can only be open for reading and writing (in embedded mode) by one process at the same time. Otherwise, the processes would overwrite each others data and corrupt the database file. To protect against this problem, whenever a database is opened, a lock file is created to signal other processes that the database is in use. If the database is closed, or if the process that opened the database stops normally, this lock file is deleted. 
advanced_1258_p=\ In special cases (if the process did not terminate normally, for example because there was a power failure), the lock file is not deleted by the process that created it. That means the existence of the lock file is not a safe protocol for file locking. However, this software uses a challenge-response protocol to protect the database files. There are two methods (algorithms) implemented to provide both security (that is, the same database files cannot be opened by two processes at the same time) and simplicity (that is, the lock file does not need to be deleted manually by the user). The two methods are 'file method' and 'socket methods'. 
advanced_1259_p=\ The file locking protocols (except the file locking method 'FS') have the following limitation\: if a shared file system is used, and the machine with the lock owner is sent to sleep (standby or hibernate), another machine may take over. If the machine that originally held the lock wakes up, the database may become corrupt. If this situation can occur, the application must ensure the database is closed when the application is put to sleep. 
advanced_1260_h3=File Locking Method 'File'
advanced_1261_p=\ The default method for database file locking is the 'File Method'. The algorithm is\: 
advanced_1262_li=If the lock file does not exist, it is created (using the atomic operation <code>File.createNewFile</code>). Then, the process waits a little bit (20 ms) and checks the file again. If the file was changed during this time, the operation is aborted. This protects against a race condition when one process deletes the lock file just after another one create it, and a third process creates the file again. It does not occur if there are only two writers. 
advanced_1263_li=\ If the file can be created, a random number is inserted together with the locking method ('file'). Afterwards, a watchdog thread is started that checks regularly (every second once by default) if the file was deleted or modified by another (challenger) thread / process. Whenever that occurs, the file is overwritten with the old data. The watchdog thread runs with high priority so that a change to the lock file does not get through undetected even if the system is very busy. However, the watchdog thread does use very little resources (CPU time), because it waits most of the time. Also, the watchdog only reads from the hard disk and does not write to it. 
advanced_1264_li=\ If the lock file exists and was recently modified, the process waits for some time (up to two seconds). If it was still changed, an exception is thrown (database is locked). This is done to eliminate race conditions with many concurrent writers. Afterwards, the file is overwritten with a new version (challenge). After that, the thread waits for 2 seconds. If there is a watchdog thread protecting the file, he will overwrite the change and this process will fail to lock the database. However, if there is no watchdog thread, the lock file will still be as written by this thread. In this case, the file is deleted and atomically created again. The watchdog thread is started in this case and the file is locked. 
advanced_1265_p=\ This algorithm is tested with over 100 concurrent threads. In some cases, when there are many concurrent threads trying to lock the database, they block each other (meaning the file cannot be locked by any of them) for some time. However, the file never gets locked by two threads at the same time. However using that many concurrent threads / processes is not the common use case. Generally, an application should throw an error to the user if it cannot open a database, and not try again in a (fast) loop. 
advanced_1266_h3=File Locking Method 'Socket'
advanced_1267_p=\ There is a second locking mechanism implemented, but disabled by default. To use it, append <code>;FILE_LOCK\=SOCKET</code> to the database URL. The algorithm is\: 
advanced_1268_li=If the lock file does not exist, it is created. Then a server socket is opened on a defined port, and kept open. The port and IP address of the process that opened the database is written into the lock file. 
advanced_1269_li=If the lock file exists, and the lock method is 'file', then the software switches to the 'file' method. 
advanced_1270_li=If the lock file exists, and the lock method is 'socket', then the process checks if the port is in use. If the original process is still running, the port is in use and this process throws an exception (database is in use). If the original process died (for example due to a power failure, or abnormal termination of the virtual machine), then the port was released. The new process deletes the lock file and starts again. 
advanced_1271_p=\ This method does not require a watchdog thread actively polling (reading) the same file every second. The problem with this method is, if the file is stored on a network share, two processes (running on different computers) could still open the same database files, if they do not have a direct TCP/IP connection. 
advanced_1272_h3=File Locking Method 'FS'
advanced_1273_p=\ This database file locking mechanism uses native file system lock on the database file. No *.lock.db file is created in this case, and no background thread is started. This mechanism may not work on all systems as expected. Some systems allow to lock the same file multiple times within the same virtual machine, and on some system native file locking is not supported or files are not unlocked after a power failure. 
advanced_1274_p=\ To enable this feature, append <code>;FILE_LOCK\=FS</code> to the database URL. 
advanced_1275_p=\ This feature is relatively new. When using it for production, please ensure your system does in fact lock files as expected. 
advanced_1276_h2=File Locking Method 'Serialized'
advanced_1277_p=\ This locking mode allows to open multiple connections to the same database. The connections may be opened from multiple processes and from different computers. When writing to the database, access is automatically synchronized internally. Write operations are slower than when using the server mode, and concurrency is relatively poor. The advantage of this mode is that there is no need to start a server. 
advanced_1278_p=\ To enable this feature, append <code>;FILE_LOCK\=SERIALIZED</code> to the database URL. 
advanced_1279_p=\ This feature is relatively new. When using it for production, please ensure your use case is well tested (if possible with automated test cases). 
advanced_1280_p=\ One known limitation when using this mode is\: queries that write to the database will fail with the exception "The database is read only", if the queries are run using <code>Statement.executeQuery()</code>. As a workaround, use <code>Statement.execute()</code> 
advanced_1281_h2=Using Passwords
advanced_1282_h3=Using Secure Passwords
advanced_1283_p=\ Remember that weak passwords can be broken regardless of the encryption and security protocols. Don't use passwords that can be found in a dictionary. Appending numbers does not make passwords secure. A way to create good passwords that can be remembered is\: take the first letters of a sentence, use upper and lower case characters, and creatively include special characters (but it's more important to use a long password than to use special characters). Example\: 
advanced_1284_code=i'sE2rtPiUKtT
advanced_1285_p=\ from the sentence <code>it's easy to remember this password if you know the trick</code>. 
advanced_1286_h3=Passwords\: Using Char Arrays instead of Strings
advanced_1287_p=\ Java strings are immutable objects and cannot be safely 'destroyed' by the application. After creating a string, it will remain in the main memory of the computer at least until it is garbage collected. The garbage collection cannot be controlled by the application, and even if it is garbage collected the data may still remain in memory. It might also be possible that the part of memory containing the password is swapped to disk (if not enough main memory is available), which is a problem if the attacker has access to the swap file of the operating system. 
advanced_1288_p=\ It is a good idea to use char arrays instead of strings for passwords. Char arrays can be cleared (filled with zeros) after use, and therefore the password will not be stored in the swap file. 
advanced_1289_p=\ This database supports using char arrays instead of string to pass user and file passwords. The following code can be used to do that\: 
advanced_1290_p=\ This example requires Java 1.6. When using Swing, use <code>javax.swing.JPasswordField</code>. 
advanced_1291_h3=Passing the User Name and/or Password in the URL
advanced_1292_p=\ Instead of passing the user name as a separate parameter as in <code> Connection conn \= DriverManager. getConnection("jdbc\:h2\:~/test", "sa", "123"); </code> the user name (and/or password) can be supplied in the URL itself\: <code> Connection conn \= DriverManager. getConnection("jdbc\:h2\:~/test;USER\=sa;PASSWORD\=123"); </code> The settings in the URL override the settings passed as a separate parameter. 
advanced_1293_h2=Password Hash
advanced_1294_p=\ Sometimes the database password needs to be stored in a configuration file (for example in the <code>web.xml</code> file). In addition to connecting with the plain text password, this database supports connecting with the password hash. This means that only the hash of the password (and not the plain text password) needs to be stored in the configuration file. This will only protect others from reading or re-constructing the plain text password (even if they have access to the configuration file); it does not protect others from accessing the database using the password hash. 
advanced_1295_p=\ To connect using the password hash instead of plain text password, append <code>;PASSWORD_HASH\=TRUE</code> to the database URL, and replace the password with the password hash. To calculate the password hash from a plain text password, run the following command within the H2 Console tool\: <code>@password_hash &lt;upperCaseUserName&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code>. As an example, if the user name is <code>sa</code> and the password is <code>test</code>, run the command <code>@password_hash SA test</code>. Then use the resulting password hash as you would use the plain text password. When using an encrypted database, then the user password and file password need to be hashed separately. To calculate the hash of the file password, run\: <code>@password_hash file &lt;filePassword&gt;</code>. 
advanced_1296_h2=Protection against SQL Injection
advanced_1297_h3=What is SQL Injection
advanced_1298_p=\ This database engine provides a solution for the security vulnerability known as 'SQL Injection'. Here is a short description of what SQL injection means. Some applications build SQL statements with embedded user input such as\: 
advanced_1299_p=\ If this mechanism is used anywhere in the application, and user input is not correctly filtered or encoded, it is possible for a user to inject SQL functionality or statements by using specially built input such as (in this example) this password\: <code>' OR ''\='</code>. In this case the statement becomes\: 
advanced_1300_p=\ Which is always true no matter what the password stored in the database is. For more information about SQL Injection, see <a href\="\#glossary_links">Glossary and Links</a>. 
advanced_1301_h3=Disabling Literals
advanced_1302_p=\ SQL Injection is not possible if user input is not directly embedded in SQL statements. A simple solution for the problem above is to use a prepared statement\: 
advanced_1303_p=\ This database provides a way to enforce usage of parameters when passing user input to the database. This is done by disabling embedded literals in SQL statements. To do this, execute the statement\: 
advanced_1304_p=\ Afterwards, SQL statements with text and number literals are not allowed any more. That means, SQL statement of the form <code>WHERE NAME\='abc'</code> or <code>WHERE CustomerId\=10</code> will fail. It is still possible to use prepared statements and parameters as described above. Also, it is still possible to generate SQL statements dynamically, and use the Statement API, as long as the SQL statements do not include literals. There is also a second mode where number literals are allowed\: <code>SET ALLOW_LITERALS NUMBERS</code>. To allow all literals, execute <code>SET ALLOW_LITERALS ALL</code> (this is the default setting). Literals can only be enabled or disabled by an administrator. 
advanced_1305_h3=Using Constants
advanced_1306_p=\ Disabling literals also means disabling hard-coded 'constant' literals. This database supports defining constants using the <code>CREATE CONSTANT</code> command. Constants can be defined only when literals are enabled, but used even when literals are disabled. To avoid name clashes with column names, constants can be defined in other schemas\: 
advanced_1307_p=\ Even when literals are enabled, it is better to use constants instead of hard-coded number or text literals in queries or views. With constants, typos are found at compile time, the source code is easier to understand and change. 
advanced_1308_h3=Using the ZERO() Function
advanced_1309_p=\ It is not required to create a constant for the number 0 as there is already a built-in function <code>ZERO()</code>\: 
advanced_1310_h2=Protection against Remote Access
advanced_1311_p=\ By default this database does not allow connections from other machines when starting the H2 Console, the TCP server, or the PG server. Remote access can be enabled using the command line options <code>-webAllowOthers, -tcpAllowOthers, -pgAllowOthers</code>. If you enable remote access, please also consider using the options <code>-baseDir, -ifExists</code>, so that remote users can not create new databases or access existing databases with weak passwords. When using the option <code>-baseDir</code>, only databases within that directory may be accessed. Ensure the existing accessible databases are protected using strong passwords. 
advanced_1312_h2=Restricting Class Loading and Usage
advanced_1313_p=\ By default there is no restriction on loading classes and executing Java code for admins. That means an admin may call system functions such as <code>System.setProperty</code> by executing\: 
advanced_1314_p=\ To restrict users (including admins) from loading classes and executing code, the list of allowed classes can be set in the system property <code>h2.allowedClasses</code> in the form of a comma separated list of classes or patterns (items ending with <code>*</code>). By default all classes are allowed. Example\: 
advanced_1315_p=\ This mechanism is used for all user classes, including database event listeners, trigger classes, user-defined functions, user-defined aggregate functions, and JDBC driver classes (with the exception of the H2 driver) when using the H2 Console. 
advanced_1316_h2=Security Protocols
advanced_1317_p=\ The following paragraphs document the security protocols used in this database. These descriptions are very technical and only intended for security experts that already know the underlying security primitives. 
advanced_1318_h3=User Password Encryption
advanced_1319_p=\ When a user tries to connect to a database, the combination of user name, @, and password are hashed using SHA-256, and this hash value is transmitted to the database. This step does not protect against an attacker that re-uses the value if he is able to listen to the (unencrypted) transmission between the client and the server. But, the passwords are never transmitted as plain text, even when using an unencrypted connection between client and server. That means if a user reuses the same password for different things, this password is still protected up to some point. See also 'RFC 2617 - HTTP Authentication\: Basic and Digest Access Authentication' for more information. 
advanced_1320_p=\ When a new database or user is created, a new random salt value is generated. The size of the salt is 64 bits. Using the random salt reduces the risk of an attacker pre-calculating hash values for many different (commonly used) passwords. 
advanced_1321_p=\ The combination of user-password hash value (see above) and salt is hashed using SHA-256. The resulting value is stored in the database. When a user tries to connect to the database, the database combines user-password hash value with the stored salt value and calculates the hash value. Other products use multiple iterations (hash the hash value again and again), but this is not done in this product to reduce the risk of denial of service attacks (where the attacker tries to connect with bogus passwords, and the server spends a lot of time calculating the hash value for each password). The reasoning is\: if the attacker has access to the hashed passwords, he also has access to the data in plain text, and therefore does not need the password any more. If the data is protected by storing it on another computer and only accessible remotely, then the iteration count is not required at all. 
advanced_1322_h3=File Encryption
advanced_1323_p=\ The database files can be encrypted using two different algorithms\: AES-128 and XTEA (using 32 rounds). The reasons for supporting XTEA is performance (XTEA is a bit faster as AES in some environments) and to have an alternative algorithm if AES is suddenly broken. Please note that the XTEA implementation used in this database only uses 32 rounds and not 64 rounds as recommended by its inventor (as of 2010, the best known attack is on 27 rounds). 
advanced_1324_p=\ When a user tries to connect to an encrypted database, the combination of <code>file@</code> and the file password is hashed using SHA-256. This hash value is transmitted to the server. 
advanced_1325_p=\ When a new database file is created, a new cryptographically secure random salt value is generated. The size of the salt is 64 bits. The combination of the file password hash and the salt value is hashed 1024 times using SHA-256. The reason for the iteration is to make it harder for an attacker to calculate hash values for common passwords. 
advanced_1326_p=\ The resulting hash value is used as the key for the block cipher algorithm (AES-128 or XTEA with 32 rounds). Then, an initialization vector (IV) key is calculated by hashing the key again using SHA-256. This is to make sure the IV is unknown to the attacker. The reason for using a secret IV is to protect against watermark attacks. 
advanced_1327_p=\ Before saving a block of data (each block is 8 bytes long), the following operations are executed\: first, the IV is calculated by encrypting the block number with the IV key (using the same block cipher algorithm). This IV is combined with the plain text using XOR. The resulting data is encrypted using the AES-128 or XTEA algorithm. 
advanced_1328_p=\ When decrypting, the operation is done in reverse. First, the block is decrypted using the key, and then the IV is calculated combined with the decrypted text using XOR. 
advanced_1329_p=\ Therefore, the block cipher mode of operation is CBC (cipher-block chaining), but each chain is only one block long. The advantage over the ECB (electronic codebook) mode is that patterns in the data are not revealed, and the advantage over multi block CBC is that flipped cipher text bits are not propagated to flipped plaintext bits in the next block. 
advanced_1330_p=\ Database encryption is meant for securing the database while it is not in use (stolen laptop and so on). It is not meant for cases where the attacker has access to files while the database is in use. When he has write access, he can for example replace pieces of files with pieces of older versions and manipulate data like this. 
advanced_1331_p=\ File encryption slows down the performance of the database engine. Compared to unencrypted mode, database operations take about 2.2 times longer when using XTEA, and 2.5 times longer using AES (embedded mode). 
advanced_1332_h3=Wrong Password / User Name Delay
advanced_1333_p=\ To protect against remote brute force password attacks, the delay after each unsuccessful login gets double as long. Use the system properties <code>h2.delayWrongPasswordMin</code> and <code>h2.delayWrongPasswordMax</code> to change the minimum (the default is 250 milliseconds) or maximum delay (the default is 4000 milliseconds, or 4 seconds). The delay only applies for those using the wrong password. Normally there is no delay for a user that knows the correct password, with one exception\: after using the wrong password, there is a delay of up to (randomly distributed) the same delay as for a wrong password. This is to protect against parallel brute force attacks, so that an attacker needs to wait for the whole delay. Delays are synchronized. This is also required to protect against parallel attacks. 
advanced_1334_p=\ There is only one exception message for both wrong user and for wrong password, to make it harder to get the list of user names. It is not possible from the stack trace to see if the user name was wrong or the password. 
advanced_1335_h3=HTTPS Connections
advanced_1336_p=\ The web server supports HTTP and HTTPS connections using <code>SSLServerSocket</code>. There is a default self-certified certificate to support an easy starting point, but custom certificates are supported as well. 
advanced_1337_h2=SSL/TLS Connections
advanced_1338_p=\ Remote SSL/TLS connections are supported using the Java Secure Socket Extension (<code>SSLServerSocket, SSLSocket</code>). By default, anonymous SSL is enabled. The default cipher suite is <code>SSL_DH_anon_WITH_RC4_128_MD5</code>. 
advanced_1339_p=\ To use your own keystore, set the system properties <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> and <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword</code> before starting the H2 server and client. See also <a href\="http\://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html\#CustomizingStores"> Customizing the Default Key and Trust Stores, Store Types, and Store Passwords</a> for more information. 
advanced_1340_p=\ To disable anonymous SSL, set the system property <code>h2.enableAnonymousSSL</code> to false. 
advanced_1341_h2=Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID)
advanced_1342_p=\ This database supports UUIDs. Also supported is a function to create new UUIDs using a cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator. With random UUIDs, the chance of two having the same value can be calculated using the probability theory. See also 'Birthday Paradox'. Standardized randomly generated UUIDs have 122 random bits. 4 bits are used for the version (Randomly generated UUID), and 2 bits for the variant (Leach-Salz). This database supports generating such UUIDs using the built-in function <code>RANDOM_UUID()</code>. Here is a small program to estimate the probability of having two identical UUIDs after generating a number of values\: 
advanced_1343_p=\ Some values are\: 
advanced_1344_th=Number of UUIs

advanced_1352_p=\ To help non-mathematicians understand what those numbers mean, here a comparison\: one's annual risk of being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion, that means the probability is about 0.000'000'000'06. 
advanced_1353_h2=Recursive Queries
advanced_1354_p=\ H2 has experimental support for recursive queries using so called "common table expressions" (CTE). Examples\: 
advanced_1355_p=\ Limitations\: Recursive queries need to be of the type <code>UNION ALL</code>, and the recursion needs to be on the second part of the query. No tables or views with the name of the table expression may exist. Different table expression names need to be used when using multiple distinct table expressions within the same transaction and for the same session. All columns of the table expression are of type <code>VARCHAR</code>, and may need to be cast to the required data type. Views with recursive queries are not supported. Subqueries and <code>INSERT INTO ... FROM</code> with recursive queries are not supported. Parameters are only supported within the last <code>SELECT</code> statement (a workaround is to use session variables like <code>@start</code> within the table expression). The syntax is\: 
advanced_1356_h2=Settings Read from System Properties
advanced_1357_p=\ Some settings of the database can be set on the command line using <code>-DpropertyName\=value</code>. It is usually not required to change those settings manually. The settings are case sensitive. Example\: 
advanced_1358_p=\ The current value of the settings can be read in the table <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS</code>. 
advanced_1359_p=\ For a complete list of settings, see <a href\="../javadoc/org/h2/constant/SysProperties.html">SysProperties</a>. 
advanced_1360_h2=Setting the Server Bind Address
advanced_1361_p=\ Usually server sockets accept connections on any/all local addresses. This may be a problem on multi-homed hosts. To bind only to one address, use the system property <code>h2.bindAddress</code>. This setting is used for both regular server sockets and for SSL server sockets. IPv4 and IPv6 address formats are supported. 
advanced_1362_h2=Pluggable File System
advanced_1363_p=\ This database supports a pluggable file system API. The file system implementation is selected using a file name prefix. Internally, the interfaces are very similar to the Java 7 NIO2 API, but do not (yet) use or require Java 7. The following file systems are included\: 
advanced_1364_code=zip\:
advanced_1365_li=\ read-only zip-file based file system. Format\: <code>zip\:/zipFileName\!/fileName</code>. 
advanced_1366_code=split\:
advanced_1367_li=\ file system that splits files in 1 GB files (stackable with other file systems). 
advanced_1368_code=nio\:
advanced_1369_li=\ file system that uses <code>FileChannel</code> instead of <code>RandomAccessFile</code> (faster in some operating systems). 
advanced_1370_code=nioMapped\:
advanced_1371_li=\ file system that uses memory mapped files (faster in some operating systems). Please note that there currently is a file size limitation of 2 GB when using this file system when using a 32-bit JVM. To work around this limitation, combine it with the split file system\: <code>split\:nioMapped\:test</code>. 
advanced_1372_code=memFS\:
advanced_1373_li=\ in-memory file system (slower than mem; experimental; mainly used for testing the database engine itself). 
advanced_1374_code=memLZF\:
advanced_1375_li=\ compressing in-memory file system (slower than memFS but uses less memory; experimental; mainly used for testing the database engine itself). 
advanced_1376_p=\ As an example, to use the the <code>nio</code> file system, use the following database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:nio\:~/test</code>. 
advanced_1377_p=\ To register a new file system, extend the classes <code>org.h2.store.fs.FilePath, FileBase</code>, and call the method <code>FilePath.register</code> before using it. 
advanced_1378_p=\ For input streams (but not for random access files), URLs may be used in addition to the registered file systems. Example\: <code>jar\:file\:///c\:/temp/example.zip\!/org/example/nested.csv</code>. To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix <code>classpath\:</code>, as in <code>classpath\:/org/h2/samples/newsfeed.sql</code>. 
advanced_1379_h2=Split File System
advanced_1380_p=\ The file system prefix <code>split\:</code> is used to split logical files into multiple physical files, for example so that a database can get larger than the maximum file system size of the operating system. If the logical file is larger than the maximum file size, then the file is split as follows\: 
advanced_1381_code=&lt;fileName&gt;
advanced_1382_li=\ (first block, is always created) 
advanced_1383_code=&lt;fileName&gt;.1.part
advanced_1384_li=\ (second block) 
advanced_1385_p=\ More physical files (<code>*.2.part, *.3.part</code>) are automatically created / deleted if needed. The maximum physical file size of a block is 2^30 bytes, which is also called 1 GiB or 1 GB. However this can be changed if required, by specifying the block size in the file name. The file name format is\: <code>split\:&lt;x&gt;\:&lt;fileName&gt;</code> where the file size per block is 2^x. For 1 MiB block sizes, use x \= 20 (because 2^20 is 1 MiB). The following file name means the logical file is split into 1 MiB blocks\: <code>split\:20\:test.h2.db</code>. An example database URL for this case is <code>jdbc\:h2\:split\:20\:~/test</code>. 
advanced_1386_h2=Database Upgrade
advanced_1387_p=\ In version 1.2, H2 introduced a new file store implementation which is incompatible to the one used in versions &lt; 1.2. To automatically convert databases to the new file store, it is necessary to include an additional jar file. The file can be found at <a href\="http\://h2database.com/h2mig_pagestore_addon.jar">http\://h2database.com/h2mig_pagestore_addon.jar</a> . If this file is in the classpath, every connect to an older database will result in a conversion process. 
advanced_1388_p=\ The conversion itself is done internally via <code>'script to'</code> and <code>'runscript from'</code>. After the conversion process, the files will be renamed from 
advanced_1389_code=dbName.data.db
advanced_1390_li=\ to <code>dbName.data.db.backup</code> 
advanced_1391_code=dbName.index.db
advanced_1392_li=\ to <code>dbName.index.db.backup</code> 
advanced_1393_p=\ by default. Also, the temporary script will be written to the database directory instead of a temporary directory. Both defaults can be customized via 
advanced_1394_code=org.h2.upgrade.DbUpgrade.setDeleteOldDb(boolean)
advanced_1395_code=org.h2.upgrade.DbUpgrade.setScriptInTmpDir(boolean)
advanced_1396_p=\ prior opening a database connection. 
advanced_1397_p=\ Since version 1.2.140 it is possible to let the old h2 classes (v 1.2.128) connect to the database. The automatic upgrade .jar file must be present, and the URL must start with <code>jdbc\:h2v1_1\:</code> (the JDBC driver class is <code>org.h2.upgrade.v1_1.Driver</code>). If the database should automatically connect using the old version if a database with the old format exists (without upgrade), and use the new version otherwise, then append <code>;NO_UPGRADE\=TRUE</code> to the database URL. Please note the old driver did not process the system property <code>"h2.baseDir"</code> correctly, so that using this setting is not supported when upgrading. 
advanced_1398_h2=Java Objects Serialization
advanced_1399_p=\ Java objects serialization is enabled by default for columns of type <code>OTHER</code>, using standard Java serialization/deserialization semantics. 
advanced_1400_p=\ To disable this feature set the system property <code>h2.serializeJavaObject\=false</code> (default\: true). 
advanced_1401_p=\ Serialization and deserialization of java objects is customizable both at system level and at database level providing a <a href\="../javadoc/org/h2/api/JavaObjectSerializer.html">JavaObjectSerializer</a> implementation\: 
advanced_1402_li=\ At system level set the system property <code>h2.javaObjectSerializer</code> with the Fully Qualified Name of the <code>JavaObjectSerializer</code> interface implementation. It will be used over the entire JVM session to (de)serialize java objects being stored in column of type OTHER. Example <code>h2.javaObjectSerializer\=com.acme.SerializerClassName</code>. 
advanced_1403_li=\ At database level execute the SQL statement <code>SET JAVA_OBJECT_SERIALIZER 'com.acme.SerializerClassName'</code> or append <code>;JAVA_OBJECT_SERIALIZER\='com.acme.SerializerClassName'</code> to the database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;JAVA_OBJECT_SERIALIZER\='com.acme.SerializerClassName'</code>. 
advanced_1404_p=\ Please note that this SQL statement can only be executed before any tables are defined. 
advanced_1405_h2=Limits and Limitations
advanced_1406_p=\ This database has the following known limitations\: 
advanced_1407_li=Database file size limit\: 4 TB (using the default page size of 2 KB) or higher (when using a larger page size). This limit is including CLOB and BLOB data. 
advanced_1408_li=The maximum file size for FAT or FAT32 file systems is 4 GB. That means when using FAT or FAT32, the limit is 4 GB for the data. This is the limitation of the file system. The database does provide a workaround for this problem, it is to use the file name prefix <code>split\:</code>. In that case files are split into files of 1 GB by default. An example database URL is\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:split\:~/test</code>. 
advanced_1409_li=The maximum number of rows per table is 2^64. 
advanced_1410_li=Main memory requirements\: The larger the database, the more main memory is required. With the current storage mechanism (the page store), the minimum main memory required is around 1 MB for each 8 GB database file size. 
advanced_1411_li=Limit on the complexity of SQL statements. Statements of the following form will result in a stack overflow exception\: 
advanced_1412_li=There is no limit for the following entities, except the memory and storage capacity\: maximum identifier length (table name, column name, and so on); maximum number of tables, columns, indexes, triggers, and other database objects; maximum statement length, number of parameters per statement, tables per statement, expressions in order by, group by, having, and so on; maximum rows per query; maximum columns per table, columns per index, indexes per table, lob columns per table, and so on; maximum row length, index row length, select row length; maximum length of a varchar column, decimal column, literal in a statement. 
advanced_1413_li=Querying from the metadata tables is slow if there are many tables (thousands). 
advanced_1414_li=For limitations on data types, see the documentation of the respective Java data type or the data type documentation of this database.

architecture_1010_h2=Introduction
architecture_1011_p=\ H2 implements an embedded and standalone ANSI-SQL89 compliant SQL engine on top of a B-tree based disk store. 
architecture_1012_p=\ As of October 2013, Thomas is still working on our next-generation storage engine called MVStore. This will in time replace the B-tree based storage engine. 
architecture_1013_h2=Top-down Overview
architecture_1014_p=\ Working from the top down, the layers look like this\: 
architecture_1015_li=JDBC driver. 
architecture_1016_li=Connection/session management. 
architecture_1017_li=SQL Parser. 
architecture_1018_li=Command execution and planning. 
architecture_1019_li=Table/Index/Constraints. 
architecture_1020_li=Undo log, redo log, and transactions layer. 
architecture_1021_li=B-tree engine and page-based storage allocation. 
architecture_1022_li=Filesystem abstraction. 
architecture_1023_h2=JDBC Driver
architecture_1024_p=\ The JDBC driver implementation lives in <code>org.h2.jdbc, org.h2.jdbcx</code> 
architecture_1025_h2=Connection/session management
architecture_1026_p=\ The primary classes of interest are\:

architecture_1036_td=remote session
architecture_1037_h2=Parser
architecture_1038_p=\ The parser lives in <code>org.h2.command.Parser</code>. It uses a straightforward recursive-descent design. 
architecture_1039_p=\ See Wikipedia <a href\="http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">Recursive-descent parser</a> page. 
architecture_1040_h2=Command execution and planning
architecture_1041_p=\ Unlike other databases, we do not have an intermediate step where we generate some kind of IR (intermediate representation) of the query. The parser class directly generates a command execution object. Then we run some optimisation steps over the command to possibly generate a more efficient command. The primary packages of interest are\:

architecture_1048_h2=Table/Index/Constraints
architecture_1049_p=\ One thing to note here is that indexes are simply stored as special kinds of tables. 
architecture_1050_p=\ The primary packages of interest are\: 
architecture_1051_th=Package
architecture_1052_th=Description
architecture_1053_td=org.h2.table
architecture_1054_td=Implementations of different kinds of tables
architecture_1055_td=org.h2.index
architecture_1056_td=Implementations of different kinds of indices
architecture_1057_h2=Undo log, redo log, and transactions layer
architecture_1058_p=\ We have a transaction log, which is shared among all sessions. See also http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_log http\://h2database.com/html/grammar.html\#set_log 
architecture_1059_p=\ We also have an undo log, which is per session, to undo an operation (an update that fails for example) and to rollback a transaction. Theoretically, the transaction log could be used, but for simplicity, H2 currently uses it's own "list of operations" (usually in-memory). 
architecture_1060_p=\ With the MVStore, this is no longer needed (just the transaction log). 
architecture_1061_h2=B-tree engine and page-based storage allocation.
architecture_1062_p=\ The primary package of interest is <code>org.h2.store</code>. 
architecture_1063_p=\ This implements a storage mechanism which allocates pages of storage (typically 2k in size) and also implements a b-tree over those pages to allow fast retrieval and update. 
architecture_1064_h2=Filesystem abstraction.
architecture_1065_p=\ The primary class of interest is <code>org.h2.store.FileStore</code>. 
architecture_1066_p=\ This implements an abstraction of a random-access file. This allows the higher layers to treat in-memory vs. on-disk vs. zip-file databases the same.

build_1072_h2=Providing Patches
build_1073_p=\ If you like to provide patches, please consider the following guidelines to simplify merging them\: 
build_1074_li=Only use Java 6 features (do not use Java 7) (see <a href\="\#environment">Environment</a>). 
build_1075_li=Follow the coding style used in the project, and use Checkstyle (see above) to verify. For example, do not use tabs (use spaces instead). The checkstyle configuration is in <code>src/installer/checkstyle.xml</code>. 
build_1076_li=A template of the Eclipse settings are in <code>src/installer/eclipse.settings/*</code>. If you want to use them, you need to copy them to the <code>.settings</code> directory. The formatting options (<code>eclipseCodeStyle</code>) are also included. 
build_1077_li=Please provide test cases and integrate them into the test suite. For Java level tests, see <code>src/test/org/h2/test/TestAll.java</code>. For SQL level tests, see <code>src/test/org/h2/test/test.in.txt</code> or <code>testSimple.in.txt</code>. 
build_1078_li=The test cases should cover at least 90% of the changed and new code; use a code coverage tool to verify that (see above). or use the build target <code>coverage</code>. 
build_1079_li=Verify that you did not break other features\: run the test cases by executing <code>build test</code>. 
build_1080_li=Provide end user documentation if required (<code>src/docsrc/html/*</code>). 
build_1081_li=Document grammar changes in <code>src/docsrc/help/help.csv</code> 
build_1082_li=Provide a change log entry (<code>src/docsrc/html/changelog.html</code>). 
build_1083_li=Verify the spelling using <code>build spellcheck</code>. If required add the new words to <code>src/tools/org/h2/build/doc/dictionary.txt</code>. 
build_1084_li=Run <code>src/installer/buildRelease</code> to find and fix formatting errors.

changelog_1190_li=Fix ABBA deadlock between adding a constraint and the H2-Log-Writer thread. 
changelog_1191_li=Optimize IN(...) queries where the values are constant and of the same type. 
changelog_1192_li=Restore tool\: the parameter "quiet" was not used and is now removed. 
changelog_1193_li=Fix ConcurrentModificationException when creating tables and executing SHOW TABLES in parallel. Reported by Viktor Voytovych. 
changelog_1194_li=Serialization is now pluggable using the system property "h2.javaObjectSerializer". Thanks to Sergi Vladykin for the patch\! 
changelog_1195_h2=Version 1.3.169 (2012-09-09)
changelog_1196_li=The default jar file is now compiled for Java 6. 
changelog_1197_li=The new jar file will probably not end up in the central Maven repository in the next few weeks because Sonatype has disabled automatic synchronization from SourceForge (which they call 'legacy sync' now). It will probably take some time until this is sorted out. The H2 jar files are deployed to http\://h2database.com/m2-repo/com/h2database/h2/maven-metadata.xml and http\://hsql.sourceforge.net/m2-repo/com/h2database/h2/maven-metadata.xml as usual. 
changelog_1198_li=A part of the documentation and the H2 Console has been changed to support the Apple retina display. 
changelog_1199_li=The CreateCluster tool could not be used if the source database contained a CLOB or BLOB. The root cause was that the TCP server did not synchronize on the session, which caused a problem when using the exclusive mode. 
changelog_1200_li=Statement.getQueryTimeout()\: only the first call to this method will query the database. If the query timeout was changed in another way than calling setQueryTimeout, this method will always return the last value. This was changed because Hibernate calls getQueryTimeout() a lot. 
changelog_1201_li=Issue 416\: PreparedStatement.setNString throws AbstractMethodError. All implemented JDBC 4 methods that don't break compatibility with Java 5 are now included in the default jar file. 
changelog_1202_li=Issue 414\: for some functions, the parameters were evaluated twice (for example "char(nextval(..))" ran "nextval(..)" twice). 
changelog_1203_li=The ResultSetMetaData methods getSchemaName and getTableName could return null instead of "" (an empty string) as specified in the JDBC API. 
changelog_1204_li=Added compatibility for "SET NAMES" query in MySQL compatibility mode.
changelog_1205_h2=Version 1.3.168 (2012-07-13)
changelog_1206_li=The message "Transaction log could not be truncated" was sometimes written to the .trace.db file even if there was no problem truncating the transaction log. 
changelog_1207_li=New system property "h2.serializeJavaObject" (default\: true) that allows to disable serializing Java objects, so that the objects compareTo and toString methods can be used. 
changelog_1208_li=Dylan has translated the H2 Console tool to Korean. Thanks a lot\! 
changelog_1209_li=Executing the statement CREATE INDEX IF ALREADY EXISTS if the index already exists no longer fails for a read only database. 
changelog_1210_li=MVCC\: concurrently updating a row could result in the row to appear deleted in the second connection, if there are multiple unique indexes (or a primary key and at least one unique index). Thanks a lot to Teruo for the patch\! 
changelog_1211_li=Fulltext search\: in-memory Lucene indexes are now supported. 
changelog_1212_li=Fulltext search\: UUID primary keys are now supported. 
changelog_1213_li=Apache Tomcat 7.x will now longer log a warning when unloading the web application, if using a connection pool. 
changelog_1214_li=H2 Console\: support the Midori browser (for Debian / Raspberry Pi) 
changelog_1215_li=When opening a remote session, don't open a temporary file if the trace level is set to zero 
changelog_1216_li=Use HMAC for authenticating remote LOB id's, removing the need for maintaining a cache, and removing the limit on the number of LOBs per result set. 
changelog_1217_li=H2 Console\: HTML and XML documents can now be edited in an updatable result set. There is (limited) support for editing multi-line documents.

faq_1019_p=\ Please read the <a href\="build.html\#support">support checklist</a>. 
faq_1020_h3=Are there Known Bugs? When is the Next Release?
faq_1021_p=\ Usually, bugs get fixes as they are found. There is a release every few weeks. Here is the list of known and confirmed issues\: 
faq_1022_li=When opening a database file in a timezone that has different daylight saving rules\: the time part of dates where the daylight saving doesn't match will differ. This is not a problem within regions that use the same rules (such as, within USA, or within Europe), even if the timezone itself is different. As a workaround, export the database to a SQL script using the old timezone, and create a new database in the new timezone. This problem does not occur when using the system property "h2.storeLocalTime" (however such database files are not compatible with older versions of H2). 
faq_1023_li=Apache Harmony\: there seems to be a bug in Harmony that affects H2. See <a href\="https\://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HARMONY-6505">HARMONY-6505</a>. 
faq_1024_li=Tomcat and Glassfish 3 set most static fields (final or non-final) to <code>null</code> when unloading a web application. This can cause a <code>NullPointerException</code> in H2 versions 1.1.107 and older, and may still not work in newer versions. Please report it if you run into this issue. In Tomcat &gt;\= 6.0 this behavior can be disabled by setting the system property <code>org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES\=false</code>, however Tomcat may then run out of memory. A known workaround is to put the <code>h2*.jar</code> file in a shared <code>lib</code> directory (<code>common/lib</code>). 
faq_1025_li=Some problems have been found with right outer join. Internally, it is converted to left outer join, which does not always produce the same results as other databases when used in combination with other joins. This problem is fixed in H2 version 1.3. 
faq_1026_li=When using Install4j before 4.1.4 on Linux and enabling <code>pack200</code>, the <code>h2*.jar</code> becomes corrupted by the install process, causing application failure. A workaround is to add an empty file <code>h2*.jar.nopack</code> next to the <code>h2*.jar</code> file. This problem is solved in Install4j 4.1.4. 
faq_1027_p=\ For a complete list, see <a href\="http\://code.google.com/p/h2database/issues/list">Open Issues</a>. 
faq_1028_h3=Is this Database Engine Open Source?
faq_1029_p=\ Yes. It is free to use and distribute, and the source code is included. See also under license. 
faq_1030_h3=Is Commercial Support Available?
faq_1031_p=\ Yes, commercial support is available, see <a href\="links.html\#commercial_support">Commercial Support</a>. 
faq_1032_h3=How to Create a New Database?
faq_1033_p=\ By default, a new database is automatically created if it does not yet exist. See <a href\="tutorial.html\#creating_new_databases">Creating New Databases</a>. 
faq_1034_h3=How to Connect to a Database?
faq_1035_p=\ The database driver is <code>org.h2.Driver</code>, and the database URL starts with <code>jdbc\:h2\:</code>. To connect to a database using JDBC, use the following code\: 
faq_1036_h3=Where are the Database Files Stored?
faq_1037_p=\ When using database URLs like <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test</code>, the database is stored in the user directory. For Windows, this is usually <code>C\:\\Documents and Settings\\&lt;userName&gt;</code> or <code>C\:\\Users\\&lt;userName&gt;</code>. If the base directory is not set (as in <code>jdbc\:h2\:test</code>), the database files are stored in the directory where the application is started (the current working directory). When using the H2 Console application from the start menu, this is <code>&lt;Installation Directory&gt;/bin</code>. The base directory can be set in the database URL. A fixed or relative path can be used. When using the URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:file\:data/sample</code>, the database is stored in the directory <code>data</code> (relative to the current working directory). The directory is created automatically if it does not yet exist. It is also possible to use the fully qualified directory name (and for Windows, drive name). Example\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:file\:C\:/data/test</code> 
faq_1038_h3=What is the Size Limit (Maximum Size) of a Database?
faq_1039_p=\ See <a href\="advanced.html\#limits_limitations">Limits and Limitations</a>. 
faq_1040_h3=Is it Reliable?
faq_1041_p=\ That is not easy to say. It is still a quite new product. A lot of tests have been written, and the code coverage of these tests is higher than 80% for each package. Randomized stress tests are run regularly. But there are probably still bugs that have not yet been found (as with most software). Some features are known to be dangerous, they are only supported for situations where performance is more important than reliability. Those dangerous features are\: 
faq_1042_li=Disabling the transaction log or FileDescriptor.sync() using LOG\=0 or LOG\=1. 
faq_1043_li=Using the transaction isolation level <code>READ_UNCOMMITTED</code> (<code>LOCK_MODE 0</code>) while at the same time using multiple connections. 
faq_1044_li=Disabling database file protection using (setting <code>FILE_LOCK</code> to <code>NO</code> in the database URL). 
faq_1045_li=Disabling referential integrity using <code>SET REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY FALSE</code>. 
faq_1046_p=\ In addition to that, running out of memory should be avoided. In older versions, OutOfMemory errors while using the database could corrupt a databases. 
faq_1047_p=\ This database is well tested using automated test cases. The tests run every night and run for more than one hour. But not all areas of this database are equally well tested. When using one of the following features for production, please ensure your use case is well tested (if possible with automated test cases). The areas that are not well tested are\: 
faq_1048_li=Platforms other than Windows XP, Linux, Mac OS X, or JVMs other than Sun 1.6 or 1.7 
faq_1049_li=The features <code>AUTO_SERVER</code> and <code>AUTO_RECONNECT</code>. 
faq_1050_li=The file locking method 'Serialized'. 
faq_1051_li=Cluster mode, 2-phase commit, savepoints. 
faq_1052_li=24/7 operation. 
faq_1053_li=Fulltext search. 
faq_1054_li=Operations on LOBs over 2 GB. 
faq_1055_li=The optimizer may not always select the best plan. 
faq_1056_li=Using the ICU4J collator. 
faq_1057_p=\ Areas considered experimental are\: 
faq_1058_li=The PostgreSQL server 
faq_1059_li=Clustering (there are cases were transaction isolation can be broken due to timing issues, for example one session overtaking another session). 
faq_1060_li=Multi-threading within the engine using <code>SET MULTI_THREADED\=1</code>. 
faq_1061_li=Compatibility modes for other databases (only some features are implemented). 
faq_1062_li=The soft reference cache (<code>CACHE_TYPE\=SOFT_LRU</code>). It might not improve performance, and out of memory issues have been reported. 
faq_1063_p=\ Some users have reported that after a power failure, the database cannot be opened sometimes. In this case, use a backup of the database or the Recover tool. Please report such problems. The plan is that the database automatically recovers in all situations. 
faq_1064_h3=Why is Opening my Database Slow?
faq_1065_p=\ To find out what the problem is, use the H2 Console and click on "Test Connection" instead of "Login". After the "Login Successful" appears, click on it (it's a link). This will list the top stack traces. Then either analyze this yourself, or post those stack traces in the Google Group. 
faq_1066_p=\ Other possible reasons are\: the database is very big (many GB), or contains linked tables that are slow to open. 
faq_1067_h3=My Query is Slow
faq_1068_p=\ Slow <code>SELECT</code> (or <code>DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE</code>) statement can have multiple reasons. Follow this checklist\: 
faq_1069_li=Run <code>ANALYZE</code> (see documentation for details). 
faq_1070_li=Run the query with <code>EXPLAIN</code> and check if indexes are used (see documentation for details). 
faq_1071_li=If required, create additional indexes and try again using <code>ANALYZE</code> and <code>EXPLAIN</code>. 
faq_1072_li=If it doesn't help please report the problem. 
faq_1073_h3=H2 is Very Slow
faq_1074_p=\ By default, H2 closes the database when the last connection is closed. If your application closes the only connection after each operation, the database is opened and closed a lot, which is quite slow. There are multiple ways to solve this problem, see <a href\="performance.html\#database_performance_tuning">Database Performance Tuning</a>. 
faq_1075_h3=Column Names are Incorrect?
faq_1076_p=\ For the query <code>SELECT ID AS X FROM TEST</code> the method <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns <code>ID</code>, I expect it to return <code>X</code>. What's wrong? 
faq_1077_p=\ This is not a bug. According the the JDBC specification, the method <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> should return the name of the column and not the alias name. If you need the alias name, use <a href\="http\://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSetMetaData.html\#getColumnLabel(int)"><code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnLabel()</code></a>. Some other database don't work like this yet (they don't follow the JDBC specification). If you need compatibility with those databases, use the <a href\="features.html\#compatibility">Compatibility Mode</a>, or append <a href\="../javadoc/org/h2/constant/DbSettings.html\#ALIAS_COLUMN_NAME"><code>;ALIAS_COLUMN_NAME\=TRUE</code></a> to the database URL. 
faq_1078_p=\ This also applies to DatabaseMetaData calls that return a result set. The columns in the JDBC API are column labels, not column names. 
faq_1079_h3=Float is Double?
faq_1080_p=\ For a table defined as <code>CREATE TABLE TEST(X FLOAT)</code> the method <code>ResultSet.getObject()</code> returns a <code>java.lang.Double</code>, I expect it to return a <code>java.lang.Float</code>. What's wrong? 
faq_1081_p=\ This is not a bug. According the the JDBC specification, the JDBC data type <code>FLOAT</code> is equivalent to <code>DOUBLE</code>, and both are mapped to <code>java.lang.Double</code>. See also <a href\="http\://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/mapping.html\#1055162"> Mapping SQL and Java Types - 8.3.10 FLOAT</a>.
faq_1082_h3=Is the GCJ Version Stable? Faster?
faq_1083_p=\ The GCJ version is not as stable as the Java version. When running the regression test with the GCJ version, sometimes the application just stops at what seems to be a random point without error message. Currently, the GCJ version is also slower than when using the Sun VM. However, the startup of the GCJ version is faster than when using a VM. 
faq_1084_h3=How to Translate this Project?
faq_1085_p=\ For more information, see <a href\="build.html\#translating">Build/Translating</a>. 
faq_1086_h3=How to Contribute to this Project?
faq_1087_p=\ There are various way to help develop an open source project like H2. The first step could be to <a href\="build.html\#translating">translate</a> the error messages and the GUI to your native language. Then, you could <a href\="build.html\#providing_patches">provide patches</a>. Please start with small patches. That could be adding a test case to improve the <a href\="build.html\#automated">code coverage</a> (the target code coverage for this project is 90%, higher is better). You will have to <a href\="build.html">develop, build and run the tests</a>. Once you are familiar with the code, you could implement missing features from the <a href\="roadmap.html">feature request list</a>. I suggest to start with very small features that are easy to implement. Keep in mind to provide test cases as well.

features_1269_p=\ For a list of applications that work with or use H2, see\: <a href\="links.html">Links</a>. 
features_1270_h2=Connection Modes
features_1271_p=\ The following connection modes are supported\: 
features_1272_li=Embedded mode (local connections using JDBC) 
features_1273_li=Server mode (remote connections using JDBC or ODBC over TCP/IP) 
features_1274_li=Mixed mode (local and remote connections at the same time) 
features_1275_h3=Embedded Mode
features_1276_p=\ In embedded mode, an application opens a database from within the same JVM using JDBC. This is the fastest and easiest connection mode. The disadvantage is that a database may only be open in one virtual machine (and class loader) at any time. As in all modes, both persistent and in-memory databases are supported. There is no limit on the number of database open concurrently, or on the number of open connections. 
features_1277_h3=Server Mode
features_1278_p=\ When using the server mode (sometimes called remote mode or client/server mode), an application opens a database remotely using the JDBC or ODBC API. A server needs to be started within the same or another virtual machine, or on another computer. Many applications can connect to the same database at the same time, by connecting to this server. Internally, the server process opens the database(s) in embedded mode. 
features_1279_p=\ The server mode is slower than the embedded mode, because all data is transferred over TCP/IP. As in all modes, both persistent and in-memory databases are supported. There is no limit on the number of database open concurrently per server, or on the number of open connections. 
features_1280_h3=Mixed Mode
features_1281_p=\ The mixed mode is a combination of the embedded and the server mode. The first application that connects to a database does that in embedded mode, but also starts a server so that other applications (running in different processes or virtual machines) can concurrently access the same data. The local connections are as fast as if the database is used in just the embedded mode, while the remote connections are a bit slower. 
features_1282_p=\ The server can be started and stopped from within the application (using the server API), or automatically (automatic mixed mode). When using the <a href\="\#auto_mixed_mode">automatic mixed mode</a>, all clients that want to connect to the database (no matter if it's an local or remote connection) can do so using the exact same database URL. 
features_1283_h2=Database URL Overview
features_1284_p=\ This database supports multiple connection modes and connection settings. This is achieved using different database URLs. Settings in the URLs are not case sensitive.

features_1348_td=\ jdbc\:h2\:file\:~/sample;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT\=3
features_1349_h2=Connecting to an Embedded (Local) Database
features_1350_p=\ The database URL for connecting to a local database is <code>jdbc\:h2\:[file\:][&lt;path&gt;]&lt;databaseName&gt;</code>. The prefix <code>file\:</code> is optional. If no or only a relative path is used, then the current working directory is used as a starting point. The case sensitivity of the path and database name depend on the operating system, however it is recommended to use lowercase letters only. The database name must be at least three characters long (a limitation of <code>File.createTempFile</code>). The database name must not contain a semicolon. To point to the user home directory, use <code>~/</code>, as in\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test</code>. 
features_1351_h2=In-Memory Databases
features_1352_p=\ For certain use cases (for example\: rapid prototyping, testing, high performance operations, read-only databases), it may not be required to persist data, or persist changes to the data. This database supports the in-memory mode, where the data is not persisted. 
features_1353_p=\ In some cases, only one connection to a in-memory database is required. This means the database to be opened is private. In this case, the database URL is <code>jdbc\:h2\:mem\:</code> Opening two connections within the same virtual machine means opening two different (private) databases. 
features_1354_p=\ Sometimes multiple connections to the same in-memory database are required. In this case, the database URL must include a name. Example\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:mem\:db1</code>. Accessing the same database using this URL only works within the same virtual machine and class loader environment. 
features_1355_p=\ To access an in-memory database from another process or from another computer, you need to start a TCP server in the same process as the in-memory database was created. The other processes then need to access the database over TCP/IP or SSL/TLS, using a database URL such as\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost/mem\:db1</code>. 
features_1356_p=\ By default, closing the last connection to a database closes the database. For an in-memory database, this means the content is lost. To keep the database open, add <code>;DB_CLOSE_DELAY\=-1</code> to the database URL. To keep the content of an in-memory database as long as the virtual machine is alive, use <code>jdbc\:h2\:mem\:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY\=-1</code>. 
features_1357_h2=Database Files Encryption
features_1358_p=\ The database files can be encrypted. Two encryption algorithms are supported\: AES and XTEA. To use file encryption, you need to specify the encryption algorithm (the 'cipher') and the file password (in addition to the user password) when connecting to the database. 
features_1359_h3=Creating a New Database with File Encryption
features_1360_p=\ By default, a new database is automatically created if it does not exist yet. To create an encrypted database, connect to it as it would already exist. 
features_1361_h3=Connecting to an Encrypted Database
features_1362_p=\ The encryption algorithm is set in the database URL, and the file password is specified in the password field, before the user password. A single space separates the file password and the user password; the file password itself may not contain spaces. File passwords and user passwords are case sensitive. Here is an example to connect to a password-encrypted database\: 
features_1363_h3=Encrypting or Decrypting a Database
features_1364_p=\ To encrypt an existing database, use the <code>ChangeFileEncryption</code> tool. This tool can also decrypt an encrypted database, or change the file encryption key. The tool is available from within the H2 Console in the tools section, or you can run it from the command line. The following command line will encrypt the database <code>test</code> in the user home directory with the file password <code>filepwd</code> and the encryption algorithm AES\: 
features_1365_h2=Database File Locking
features_1366_p=\ Whenever a database is opened, a lock file is created to signal other processes that the database is in use. If database is closed, or if the process that opened the database terminates, this lock file is deleted. 
features_1367_p=\ The following file locking methods are implemented\: 
features_1368_li=The default method is <code>FILE</code> and uses a watchdog thread to protect the database file. The watchdog reads the lock file each second. 
features_1369_li=The second method is <code>SOCKET</code> and opens a server socket. The socket method does not require reading the lock file every second. The socket method should only be used if the database files are only accessed by one (and always the same) computer. 
features_1370_li=The third method is <code>FS</code>. This will use native file locking using <code>FileChannel.lock</code>. 
features_1371_li=It is also possible to open the database without file locking; in this case it is up to the application to protect the database files. Failing to do so will result in a corrupted database. Using the method <code>NO</code> forces the database to not create a lock file at all. Please note that this is unsafe as another process is able to open the same database, possibly leading to data corruption.
features_1372_p=\ To open the database with a different file locking method, use the parameter <code>FILE_LOCK</code>. The following code opens the database with the 'socket' locking method\: 
features_1373_p=\ For more information about the algorithms, see <a href\="advanced.html\#file_locking_protocols">Advanced / File Locking Protocols</a>. 
features_1374_h2=Opening a Database Only if it Already Exists
features_1375_p=\ By default, when an application calls <code>DriverManager.getConnection(url, ...)</code> and the database specified in the URL does not yet exist, a new (empty) database is created. In some situations, it is better to restrict creating new databases, and only allow to open existing databases. To do this, add <code>;IFEXISTS\=TRUE</code> to the database URL. In this case, if the database does not already exist, an exception is thrown when trying to connect. The connection only succeeds when the database already exists. The complete URL may look like this\: 
features_1376_h2=Closing a Database
features_1377_h3=Delayed Database Closing
features_1378_p=\ Usually, a database is closed when the last connection to it is closed. In some situations this slows down the application, for example when it is not possible to keep at least one connection open. The automatic closing of a database can be delayed or disabled with the SQL statement <code>SET DB_CLOSE_DELAY &lt;seconds&gt;</code>. The parameter &lt;seconds&gt; specifies the number of seconds to keep a database open after the last connection to it was closed. The following statement will keep a database open for 10 seconds after the last connection was closed\: 
features_1379_p=\ The value -1 means the database is not closed automatically. The value 0 is the default and means the database is closed when the last connection is closed. This setting is persistent and can be set by an administrator only. It is possible to set the value in the database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY\=10</code>. 
features_1380_h3=Don't Close a Database when the VM Exits
features_1381_p=\ By default, a database is closed when the last connection is closed. However, if it is never closed, the database is closed when the virtual machine exits normally, using a shutdown hook. In some situations, the database should not be closed in this case, for example because the database is still used at virtual machine shutdown (to store the shutdown process in the database for example). For those cases, the automatic closing of the database can be disabled in the database URL. The first connection (the one that is opening the database) needs to set the option in the database URL (it is not possible to change the setting afterwards). The database URL to disable database closing on exit is\: 
features_1382_h2=Execute SQL on Connection
features_1383_p=\ Sometimes, particularly for in-memory databases, it is useful to be able to execute DDL or DML commands automatically when a client connects to a database. This functionality is enabled via the INIT property. Note that multiple commands may be passed to INIT, but the semicolon delimiter must be escaped, as in the example below. 
features_1384_p=\ Please note the double backslash is only required in a Java or properties file. In a GUI, or in an XML file, only one backslash is required\: 
features_1385_p=\ Backslashes within the init script (for example within a runscript statement, to specify the folder names in Windows) need to be escaped as well (using a second backslash). It might be simpler to avoid backslashes in folder names for this reason; use forward slashes instead. 
features_1386_h2=Ignore Unknown Settings
features_1387_p=\ Some applications (for example OpenOffice.org Base) pass some additional parameters when connecting to the database. Why those parameters are passed is unknown. The parameters <code>PREFERDOSLIKELINEENDS</code> and <code>IGNOREDRIVERPRIVILEGES</code> are such examples; they are simply ignored to improve the compatibility with OpenOffice.org. If an application passes other parameters when connecting to the database, usually the database throws an exception saying the parameter is not supported. It is possible to ignored such parameters by adding <code>;IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS\=TRUE</code> to the database URL. 
features_1388_h2=Changing Other Settings when Opening a Connection
features_1389_p=\ In addition to the settings already described, other database settings can be passed in the database URL. Adding <code>;setting\=value</code> at the end of a database URL is the same as executing the statement <code>SET setting value</code> just after connecting. For a list of supported settings, see <a href\="grammar.html">SQL Grammar</a> or the <a href\="../javadoc/org/h2/constant/DbSettings.html">DbSettings</a> javadoc. 
features_1390_h2=Custom File Access Mode
features_1391_p=\ Usually, the database opens the database file with the access mode <code>rw</code>, meaning read-write (except for read only databases, where the mode <code>r</code> is used). To open a database in read-only mode if the database file is not read-only, use <code>ACCESS_MODE_DATA\=r</code>. Also supported are <code>rws</code> and <code>rwd</code>. This setting must be specified in the database URL\: 
features_1392_p=\ For more information see <a href\="advanced.html\#durability_problems">Durability Problems</a>. On many operating systems the access mode <code>rws</code> does not guarantee that the data is written to the disk. 
features_1393_h2=Multiple Connections
features_1394_h3=Opening Multiple Databases at the Same Time
features_1395_p=\ An application can open multiple databases at the same time, including multiple connections to the same database. The number of open database is only limited by the memory available. 
features_1396_h3=Multiple Connections to the Same Database\: Client/Server
features_1397_p=\ If you want to access the same database at the same time from different processes or computers, you need to use the client / server mode. In this case, one process acts as the server, and the other processes (that could reside on other computers as well) connect to the server via TCP/IP (or SSL/TLS over TCP/IP for improved security). 
features_1398_h3=Multithreading Support
features_1399_p=\ This database is multithreading-safe. That means, if an application is multi-threaded, it does not need to worry about synchronizing access to the database. Internally, most requests to the same database are synchronized. That means an application can use multiple threads that access the same database at the same time, however if one thread executes a long running query, the other threads need to wait. 
features_1400_p=\ An application should normally use one connection per thread. This database synchronizes access to the same connection, but other databases may not do this. 
features_1401_h3=Locking, Lock-Timeout, Deadlocks
features_1402_p=\ Unless <a href\="advanced.html\#mvcc">multi-version concurrency</a> is used, the database uses table level locks to give each connection a consistent state of the data. There are two kinds of locks\: read locks (shared locks) and write locks (exclusive locks). All locks are released when the transaction commits or rolls back. When using the default transaction isolation level 'read committed', read locks are already released after each statement. 
features_1403_p=\ If a connection wants to reads from a table, and there is no write lock on the table, then a read lock is added to the table. If there is a write lock, then this connection waits for the other connection to release the lock. If a connection cannot get a lock for a specified time, then a lock timeout exception is thrown. 
features_1404_p=\ Usually, <code>SELECT</code> statements will generate read locks. This includes subqueries. Statements that modify data use write locks. It is also possible to lock a table exclusively without modifying data, using the statement <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>. The statements <code>COMMIT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK</code> releases all open locks. The commands <code>SAVEPOINT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code> don't affect locks. The locks are also released when the autocommit mode changes, and for connections with autocommit set to true (this is the default), locks are released after each statement. The following statements generate locks\: 
features_1405_th=Type of Lock
features_1406_th=SQL Statement
features_1407_td=Read
features_1408_td=SELECT * FROM TEST;
features_1409_td=\ CALL SELECT MAX(ID) FROM TEST;
features_1410_td=\ SCRIPT;
features_1411_td=Write
features_1412_td=SELECT * FROM TEST WHERE 1\=0 FOR UPDATE;
features_1413_td=Write
features_1414_td=INSERT INTO TEST VALUES(1, 'Hello');
features_1415_td=\ INSERT INTO TEST SELECT * FROM TEST;
features_1416_td=\ UPDATE TEST SET NAME\='Hi';
features_1417_td=\ DELETE FROM TEST;
features_1418_td=Write
features_1419_td=ALTER TABLE TEST ...;
features_1420_td=\ CREATE INDEX ... ON TEST ...;
features_1421_td=\ DROP INDEX ...;
features_1422_p=\ The number of seconds until a lock timeout exception is thrown can be set separately for each connection using the SQL command <code>SET LOCK_TIMEOUT &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code>. The initial lock timeout (that is the timeout used for new connections) can be set using the SQL command <code>SET DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code>. The default lock timeout is persistent. 
features_1423_h3=Avoiding Deadlocks
features_1424_p=\ To avoid deadlocks, ensure that all transactions lock the tables in the same order (for example in alphabetical order), and avoid upgrading read locks to write locks. Both can be achieved using explicitly locking tables using <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>. 
features_1425_h2=Database File Layout
features_1426_p=\ The following files are created for persistent databases\: 
features_1427_th=File Name
features_1428_th=Description
features_1429_th=Number of Files
features_1430_td=\ test.h2.db 
features_1431_td=\ Database file.
features_1432_td=\ Contains the transaction log, indexes, and data for all tables.
features_1433_td=\ Format\: <code>&lt;database&gt;.h2.db</code> 
features_1434_td=\ 1 per database 
features_1435_td=\ test.lock.db 
features_1436_td=\ Database lock file.
features_1437_td=\ Automatically (re-)created while the database is in use.
features_1438_td=\ Format\: <code>&lt;database&gt;.lock.db</code> 
features_1439_td=\ 1 per database (only if in use) 
features_1440_td=\ test.trace.db 
features_1441_td=\ Trace file (if the trace option is enabled).
features_1442_td=\ Contains trace information.
features_1443_td=\ Format\: <code>&lt;database&gt;.trace.db</code>
features_1444_td=\ Renamed to <code>&lt;database&gt;.trace.db.old</code> is too big. 
features_1445_td=\ 0 or 1 per database 
features_1446_td=\ test.lobs.db/* 
features_1447_td=\ Directory containing one file for each
features_1448_td=\ BLOB or CLOB value larger than a certain size.
features_1449_td=\ Format\: <code>&lt;id&gt;.t&lt;tableId&gt;.lob.db</code> 
features_1450_td=\ 1 per large object 
features_1451_td=\ test.123.temp.db 
features_1452_td=\ Temporary file.
features_1453_td=\ Contains a temporary blob or a large result set.
features_1454_td=\ Format\: <code>&lt;database&gt;.&lt;id&gt;.temp.db</code> 
features_1455_td=\ 1 per object 
features_1456_h3=Moving and Renaming Database Files
features_1457_p=\ Database name and location are not stored inside the database files. 
features_1458_p=\ While a database is closed, the files can be moved to another directory, and they can be renamed as well (as long as all files of the same database start with the same name and the respective extensions are unchanged). 
features_1459_p=\ As there is no platform specific data in the files, they can be moved to other operating systems without problems. 
features_1460_h3=Backup
features_1461_p=\ When the database is closed, it is possible to backup the database files. 
features_1462_p=\ To backup data while the database is running, the SQL commands <code>SCRIPT</code> and <code>BACKUP</code> can be used. 
features_1463_h2=Logging and Recovery
features_1464_p=\ Whenever data is modified in the database and those changes are committed, the changes are written to the transaction log (except for in-memory objects). The changes to the main data area itself are usually written later on, to optimize disk access. If there is a power failure, the main data area is not up-to-date, but because the changes are in the transaction log, the next time the database is opened, the changes are re-applied automatically. 
features_1465_h2=Compatibility
features_1466_p=\ All database engines behave a little bit different. Where possible, H2 supports the ANSI SQL standard, and tries to be compatible to other databases. There are still a few differences however\: 
features_1467_p=\ In MySQL text columns are case insensitive by default, while in H2 they are case sensitive. However H2 supports case insensitive columns as well. To create the tables with case insensitive texts, append <code>IGNORECASE\=TRUE</code> to the database URL (example\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;IGNORECASE\=TRUE</code>). 
features_1468_h3=Compatibility Modes
features_1469_p=\ For certain features, this database can emulate the behavior of specific databases. However, only a small subset of the differences between databases are implemented in this way. Here is the list of currently supported modes and the differences to the regular mode\: 
features_1470_h3=DB2 Compatibility Mode
features_1471_p=\ To use the IBM DB2 mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=DB2</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE DB2</code>. 
features_1472_li=For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 
features_1473_li=Support for the syntax <code>[OFFSET .. ROW] [FETCH ... ONLY]</code> as an alternative for <code>LIMIT .. OFFSET</code>. 
features_1474_li=Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 
features_1475_li=Support the pseudo-table SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1. 
features_1476_h3=Derby Compatibility Mode
features_1477_p=\ To use the Apache Derby mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=Derby</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE Derby</code>. 
features_1478_li=For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 
features_1479_li=For unique indexes, <code>NULL</code> is distinct. That means only one row with <code>NULL</code> in one of the columns is allowed. 
features_1480_li=Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 
features_1481_li=Support the pseudo-table SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1. 
features_1482_h3=HSQLDB Compatibility Mode
features_1483_p=\ To use the HSQLDB mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=HSQLDB</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE HSQLDB</code>. 
features_1484_li=For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 
features_1485_li=When converting the scale of decimal data, the number is only converted if the new scale is smaller than the current scale. Usually, the scale is converted and 0s are added if required. 
features_1486_li=For unique indexes, <code>NULL</code> is distinct. That means only one row with <code>NULL</code> in one of the columns is allowed. 
features_1487_li=Text can be concatenated using '+'. 
features_1488_h3=MS SQL Server Compatibility Mode
features_1489_p=\ To use the MS SQL Server mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=MSSQLServer</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE MSSQLServer</code>. 
features_1490_li=For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 
features_1491_li=Identifiers may be quoted using square brackets as in <code>[Test]</code>. 
features_1492_li=For unique indexes, <code>NULL</code> is distinct. That means only one row with <code>NULL</code> in one of the columns is allowed. 
features_1493_li=Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 
features_1494_li=Text can be concatenated using '+'. 
features_1495_h3=MySQL Compatibility Mode
features_1496_p=\ To use the MySQL mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=MySQL</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE MySQL</code>. 
features_1497_li=When inserting data, if a column is defined to be <code>NOT NULL</code> and <code>NULL</code> is inserted, then a 0 (or empty string, or the current timestamp for timestamp columns) value is used. Usually, this operation is not allowed and an exception is thrown. 
features_1498_li=Creating indexes in the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement is allowed using <code>INDEX(..)</code> or <code>KEY(..)</code>. Example\: <code>create table test(id int primary key, name varchar(255), key idx_name(name));</code> 
features_1499_li=Meta data calls return identifiers in lower case. 
features_1500_li=When converting a floating point number to an integer, the fractional digits are not truncated, but the value is rounded. 
features_1501_li=Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 
features_1502_p=\ Text comparison in MySQL is case insensitive by default, while in H2 it is case sensitive (as in most other databases). H2 does support case insensitive text comparison, but it needs to be set separately, using <code>SET IGNORECASE TRUE</code>. This affects comparison using <code>\=, LIKE, REGEXP</code>. 
features_1503_h3=Oracle Compatibility Mode
features_1504_p=\ To use the Oracle mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=Oracle</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE Oracle</code>. 
features_1505_li=For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 
features_1506_li=When using unique indexes, multiple rows with <code>NULL</code> in all columns are allowed, however it is not allowed to have multiple rows with the same values otherwise. 
features_1507_li=Concatenating <code>NULL</code> with another value results in the other value. 
features_1508_li=Empty strings are treated like <code>NULL</code> values. 
features_1509_h3=PostgreSQL Compatibility Mode
features_1510_p=\ To use the PostgreSQL mode, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;MODE\=PostgreSQL</code> or the SQL statement <code>SET MODE PostgreSQL</code>. 
features_1511_li=For aliased columns, <code>ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName()</code> returns the alias name and <code>getTableName()</code> returns <code>null</code>. 
features_1512_li=When converting a floating point number to an integer, the fractional digits are not be truncated, but the value is rounded. 
features_1513_li=The system columns <code>CTID</code> and <code>OID</code> are supported. 
features_1514_li=LOG(x) is base 10 in this mode. 
features_1515_h2=Auto-Reconnect
features_1516_p=\ The auto-reconnect feature causes the JDBC driver to reconnect to the database if the connection is lost. The automatic re-connect only occurs when auto-commit is enabled; if auto-commit is disabled, an exception is thrown. To enable this mode, append <code>;AUTO_RECONNECT\=TRUE</code> to the database URL. 
features_1517_p=\ Re-connecting will open a new session. After an automatic re-connect, variables and local temporary tables definitions (excluding data) are re-created. The contents of the system table <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_STATE</code> contains all client side state that is re-created. 
features_1518_p=\ If another connection uses the database in exclusive mode (enabled using <code>SET EXCLUSIVE 1</code> or <code>SET EXCLUSIVE 2</code>), then this connection will try to re-connect until the exclusive mode ends. 
features_1519_h2=Automatic Mixed Mode
features_1520_p=\ Multiple processes can access the same database without having to start the server manually. To do that, append <code>;AUTO_SERVER\=TRUE</code> to the database URL. You can use the same database URL independent of whether the database is already open or not. This feature doesn't work with in-memory databases. Example database URL\: 
features_1521_p=\ Use the same URL for all connections to this database. Internally, when using this mode, the first connection to the database is made in embedded mode, and additionally a server is started internally (as a daemon thread). If the database is already open in another process, the server mode is used automatically. The IP address and port of the server are stored in the file <code>.lock.db</code>, that's why in-memory databases can't be supported. 
features_1522_p=\ The application that opens the first connection to the database uses the embedded mode, which is faster than the server mode. Therefore the main application should open the database first if possible. The first connection automatically starts a server on a random port. This server allows remote connections, however only to this database (to ensure that, the client reads <code>.lock.db</code> file and sends the the random key that is stored there to the server). When the first connection is closed, the server stops. If other (remote) connections are still open, one of them will then start a server (auto-reconnect is enabled automatically). 
features_1523_p=\ All processes need to have access to the database files. If the first connection is closed (the connection that started the server), open transactions of other connections will be rolled back (this may not be a problem if you don't disable autocommit). Explicit client/server connections (using <code>jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://</code> or <code>ssl\://</code>) are not supported. This mode is not supported for in-memory databases. 
features_1524_p=\ Here is an example how to use this mode. Application 1 and 2 are not necessarily started on the same computer, but they need to have access to the database files. Application 1 and 2 are typically two different processes (however they could run within the same process). 
features_1525_p=\ When using this feature, by default the server uses any free TCP port. The port can be set manually using <code>AUTO_SERVER_PORT\=9090</code>. 
features_1526_h2=Page Size
features_1527_p=\ The page size for new databases is 2 KB (2048), unless the page size is set explicitly in the database URL using <code>PAGE_SIZE\=</code> when the database is created. The page size of existing databases can not be changed, so this property needs to be set when the database is created. 
features_1528_h2=Using the Trace Options
features_1529_p=\ To find problems in an application, it is sometimes good to see what database operations where executed. This database offers the following trace features\: 
features_1530_li=Trace to <code>System.out</code> and/or to a file 
features_1531_li=Support for trace levels <code>OFF, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG</code> 
features_1532_li=The maximum size of the trace file can be set 
features_1533_li=It is possible to generate Java source code from the trace file 
features_1534_li=Trace can be enabled at runtime by manually creating a file 
features_1535_h3=Trace Options
features_1536_p=\ The simplest way to enable the trace option is setting it in the database URL. There are two settings, one for <code>System.out</code> (<code>TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT</code>) tracing, and one for file tracing (<code>TRACE_LEVEL_FILE</code>). The trace levels are 0 for <code>OFF</code>, 1 for <code>ERROR</code> (the default), 2 for <code>INFO</code>, and 3 for <code>DEBUG</code>. A database URL with both levels set to <code>DEBUG</code> is\: 
features_1537_p=\ The trace level can be changed at runtime by executing the SQL command <code>SET TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT level</code> (for <code>System.out</code> tracing) or <code>SET TRACE_LEVEL_FILE level</code> (for file tracing). Example\: 
features_1538_h3=Setting the Maximum Size of the Trace File
features_1539_p=\ When using a high trace level, the trace file can get very big quickly. The default size limit is 16 MB, if the trace file exceeds this limit, it is renamed to <code>.old</code> and a new file is created. If another such file exists, it is deleted. To limit the size to a certain number of megabytes, use <code>SET TRACE_MAX_FILE_SIZE mb</code>. Example\: 
features_1540_h3=Java Code Generation
features_1541_p=\ When setting the trace level to <code>INFO</code> or <code>DEBUG</code>, Java source code is generated as well. This simplifies reproducing problems. The trace file looks like this\: 
features_1542_p=\ To filter the Java source code, use the <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool as follows\: 
features_1543_p=\ The generated file <code>Test.java</code> will contain the Java source code. The generated source code may be too large to compile (the size of a Java method is limited). If this is the case, the source code needs to be split in multiple methods. The password is not listed in the trace file and therefore not included in the source code. 
features_1544_h2=Using Other Logging APIs
features_1545_p=\ By default, this database uses its own native 'trace' facility. This facility is called 'trace' and not 'log' within this database to avoid confusion with the transaction log. Trace messages can be written to both file and <code>System.out</code>. In most cases, this is sufficient, however sometimes it is better to use the same facility as the application, for example Log4j. To do that, this database support SLF4J. 
features_1546_a=SLF4J
features_1547_p=\ is a simple facade for various logging APIs and allows to plug in the desired implementation at deployment time. SLF4J supports implementations such as Logback, Log4j, Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL), Java logging, x4juli, and Simple Log. 
features_1548_p=\ To enable SLF4J, set the file trace level to 4 in the database URL\: 
features_1549_p=\ Changing the log mechanism is not possible after the database is open, that means executing the SQL statement <code>SET TRACE_LEVEL_FILE 4</code> when the database is already open will not have the desired effect. To use SLF4J, all required jar files need to be in the classpath. The logger name is <code>h2database</code>. If it does not work, check the file <code>&lt;database&gt;.trace.db</code> for error messages. 
features_1550_h2=Read Only Databases
features_1551_p=\ If the database files are read-only, then the database is read-only as well. It is not possible to create new tables, add or modify data in this database. Only <code>SELECT</code> and <code>CALL</code> statements are allowed. To create a read-only database, close the database. Then, make the database file read-only. When you open the database now, it is read-only. There are two ways an application can find out whether database is read-only\: by calling <code>Connection.isReadOnly()</code> or by executing the SQL statement <code>CALL READONLY()</code>. 
features_1552_p=\ Using the <a href\="\#custom_access_mode">Custom Access Mode</a> <code>r</code> the database can also be opened in read-only mode, even if the database file is not read only. 
features_1553_h2=Read Only Databases in Zip or Jar File
features_1554_p=\ To create a read-only database in a zip file, first create a regular persistent database, and then create a backup. The database must not have pending changes, that means you need to close all connections to the database first. To speed up opening the read-only database and running queries, the database should be closed using <code>SHUTDOWN DEFRAG</code>. If you are using a database named <code>test</code>, an easy way to create a zip file is using the <code>Backup</code> tool. You can start the tool from the command line, or from within the H2 Console (Tools - Backup). Please note that the database must be closed when the backup is created. Therefore, the SQL statement <code>BACKUP TO</code> can not be used. 
features_1555_p=\ When the zip file is created, you can open the database in the zip file using the following database URL\: 
features_1556_p=\ Databases in zip files are read-only. The performance for some queries will be slower than when using a regular database, because random access in zip files is not supported (only streaming). How much this affects the performance depends on the queries and the data. The database is not read in memory; therefore large databases are supported as well. The same indexes are used as when using a regular database. 
features_1557_p=\ If the database is larger than a few megabytes, performance is much better if the database file is split into multiple smaller files, because random access in compressed files is not possible. See also the sample application <a href\="http\://code.google.com/p/h2database/source/browse/trunk/h2/src/test/org/h2/samples/ReadOnlyDatabaseInZip.java">ReadOnlyDatabaseInZip</a>. 
features_1558_h3=Opening a Corrupted Database
features_1559_p=\ If a database cannot be opened because the boot info (the SQL script that is run at startup) is corrupted, then the database can be opened by specifying a database event listener. The exceptions are logged, but opening the database will continue. 
features_1560_h2=Computed Columns / Function Based Index
features_1561_p=\ A computed column is a column whose value is calculated before storing. The formula is evaluated when the row is inserted, and re-evaluated every time the row is updated. One use case is to automatically update the last-modification time\: 
features_1562_p=\ Function indexes are not directly supported by this database, but they can be emulated by using computed columns. For example, if an index on the upper-case version of a column is required, create a computed column with the upper-case version of the original column, and create an index for this column\: 
features_1563_p=\ When inserting data, it is not required (and not allowed) to specify a value for the upper-case version of the column, because the value is generated. But you can use the column when querying the table\: 
features_1564_h2=Multi-Dimensional Indexes
features_1565_p=\ A tool is provided to execute efficient multi-dimension (spatial) range queries. This database does not support a specialized spatial index (R-Tree or similar). Instead, the B-Tree index is used. For each record, the multi-dimensional key is converted (mapped) to a single dimensional (scalar) value. This value specifies the location on a space-filling curve. 
features_1566_p=\ Currently, Z-order (also called N-order or Morton-order) is used; Hilbert curve could also be used, but the implementation is more complex. The algorithm to convert the multi-dimensional value is called bit-interleaving. The scalar value is indexed using a B-Tree index (usually using a computed column). 
features_1567_p=\ The method can result in a drastic performance improvement over just using an index on the first column. Depending on the data and number of dimensions, the improvement is usually higher than factor 5. The tool generates a SQL query from a specified multi-dimensional range. The method used is not database dependent, and the tool can easily be ported to other databases. For an example how to use the tool, please have a look at the sample code provided in <code>TestMultiDimension.java</code>. 
features_1568_h2=User-Defined Functions and Stored Procedures
features_1569_p=\ In addition to the built-in functions, this database supports user-defined Java functions. In this database, Java functions can be used as stored procedures as well. A function must be declared (registered) before it can be used. A function can be defined using source code, or as a reference to a compiled class that is available in the classpath. By default, the function aliases are stored in the current schema. 
features_1570_h3=Referencing a Compiled Method
features_1571_p=\ When referencing a method, the class must already be compiled and included in the classpath where the database is running. Only static Java methods are supported; both the class and the method must be public. Example Java class\: 
features_1572_p=\ The Java function must be registered in the database by calling <code>CREATE ALIAS ... FOR</code>\: 
features_1573_p=\ For a complete sample application, see <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/Function.java</code>. 
features_1574_h3=Declaring Functions as Source Code
features_1575_p=\ When defining a function alias with source code, the database tries to compile the source code using the Sun Java compiler (the class <code>com.sun.tools.javac.Main</code>) if the <code>tools.jar</code> is in the classpath. If not, <code>javac</code> is run as a separate process. Only the source code is stored in the database; the class is compiled each time the database is re-opened. Source code is usually passed as dollar quoted text to avoid escaping problems, however single quotes can be used as well. Example\: 
features_1576_p=\ By default, the three packages <code>java.util, java.math, java.sql</code> are imported. The method name (<code>nextPrime</code> in the example above) is ignored. Method overloading is not supported when declaring functions as source code, that means only one method may be declared for an alias. If different import statements are required, they must be declared at the beginning and separated with the tag <code>@CODE</code>\: 
features_1577_p=\ The following template is used to create a complete Java class\: 
features_1578_h3=Method Overloading
features_1579_p=\ Multiple methods may be bound to a SQL function if the class is already compiled and included in the classpath. Each Java method must have a different number of arguments. Method overloading is not supported when declaring functions as source code. 
features_1580_h3=Function Data Type Mapping
features_1581_p=\ Functions that accept non-nullable parameters such as <code>int</code> will not be called if one of those parameters is <code>NULL</code>. Instead, the result of the function is <code>NULL</code>. If the function should be called if a parameter is <code>NULL</code>, you need to use <code>java.lang.Integer</code> instead. 
features_1582_p=\ SQL types are mapped to Java classes and vice-versa as in the JDBC API. For details, see <a href\="datatypes.html">Data Types</a>. There are a few special cases\: <code>java.lang.Object</code> is mapped to <code>OTHER</code> (a serialized object). Therefore, <code>java.lang.Object</code> can not be used to match all SQL types (matching all SQL types is not supported). The second special case is <code>Object[]</code>\: arrays of any class are mapped to <code>ARRAY</code>. Objects of type <code>org.h2.value.Value</code> (the internal value class) are passed through without conversion. 
features_1583_h3=Functions That Require a Connection
features_1584_p=\ If the first parameter of a Java function is a <code>java.sql.Connection</code>, then the connection to database is provided. This connection does not need to be closed before returning. When calling the method from within the SQL statement, this connection parameter does not need to be (can not be) specified. 
features_1585_h3=Functions Throwing an Exception
features_1586_p=\ If a function throws an exception, then the current statement is rolled back and the exception is thrown to the application. SQLException are directly re-thrown to the calling application; all other exceptions are first converted to a SQLException. 
features_1587_h3=Functions Returning a Result Set
features_1588_p=\ Functions may returns a result set. Such a function can be called with the <code>CALL</code> statement\: 
features_1589_h3=Using SimpleResultSet
features_1590_p=\ A function can create a result set using the <code>SimpleResultSet</code> tool\: 
features_1591_h3=Using a Function as a Table
features_1592_p=\ A function that returns a result set can be used like a table. However, in this case the function is called at least twice\: first while parsing the statement to collect the column names (with parameters set to <code>null</code> where not known at compile time). And then, while executing the statement to get the data (maybe multiple times if this is a join). If the function is called just to get the column list, the URL of the connection passed to the function is <code>jdbc\:columnlist\:connection</code>. Otherwise, the URL of the connection is <code>jdbc\:default\:connection</code>. 
features_1593_h2=Pluggable or User-Defined Tables
features_1594_p=\ For situations where you need to expose other data-sources to the SQL engine as a table, there are "pluggable tables". For some examples, have a look at the code in <code>org.h2.test.db.TestTableEngines</code>. 
features_1595_p=\ In order to create your own TableEngine, you need to implement the <code>org.h2.api.TableEngine</code> interface e.g. something like this\: 
features_1596_p=\ and then create the table from SQL like this\: 
features_1597_p=\ It is also possible to pass in parameters to the table engine, like so\: 
features_1598_p=\ In which case the parameters are passed down in the tableEngineParams field of the CreateTableData object. 
features_1599_h2=Triggers
features_1600_p=\ This database supports Java triggers that are called before or after a row is updated, inserted or deleted. Triggers can be used for complex consistency checks, or to update related data in the database. It is also possible to use triggers to simulate materialized views. For a complete sample application, see <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/TriggerSample.java</code>. A Java trigger must implement the interface <code>org.h2.api.Trigger</code>. The trigger class must be available in the classpath of the database engine (when using the server mode, it must be in the classpath of the server). 
features_1601_p=\ The connection can be used to query or update data in other tables. The trigger then needs to be defined in the database\: 
features_1602_p=\ The trigger can be used to veto a change by throwing a <code>SQLException</code>. 
features_1603_p=\ As an alternative to implementing the <code>Trigger</code> interface, an application can extend the abstract class <code>org.h2.tools.TriggerAdapter</code>. This will allows to use the <code>ResultSet</code> interface within trigger implementations. In this case, only the <code>fire</code> method needs to be implemented\: 
features_1604_h2=Compacting a Database
features_1605_p=\ Empty space in the database file re-used automatically. When closing the database, the database is automatically compacted for up to 200 milliseconds by default. To compact more, use the SQL statement SHUTDOWN COMPACT. However re-creating the database may further reduce the database size because this will re-build the indexes. Here is a sample function to do this\: 
features_1606_p=\ See also the sample application <code>org.h2.samples.Compact</code>. The commands <code>SCRIPT / RUNSCRIPT</code> can be used as well to create a backup of a database and re-build the database from the script. 
features_1607_h2=Cache Settings
features_1608_p=\ The database keeps most frequently used data in the main memory. The amount of memory used for caching can be changed using the setting <code>CACHE_SIZE</code>. This setting can be set in the database connection URL (<code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;CACHE_SIZE\=131072</code>), or it can be changed at runtime using <code>SET CACHE_SIZE size</code>. The size of the cache, as represented by <code>CACHE_SIZE</code> is measured in KB, with each KB being 1024 bytes. This setting has no effect for in-memory databases. For persistent databases, the setting is stored in the database and re-used when the database is opened the next time. However, when opening an existing database, the cache size is set to at most half the amount of memory available for the virtual machine (Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()), even if the cache size setting stored in the database is larger; however the setting stored in the database is kept. Setting the cache size in the database URL or explicitly using <code>SET CACHE_SIZE</code> overrides this value (even if larger than the physical memory). To get the current used maximum cache size, use the query <code>SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS WHERE NAME \= 'info.CACHE_MAX_SIZE'</code> 
features_1609_p=\ An experimental scan-resistant cache algorithm "Two Queue" (2Q) is available. To enable it, append <code>;CACHE_TYPE\=TQ</code> to the database URL. The cache might not actually improve performance. If you plan to use it, please run your own test cases first. 
features_1610_p=\ Also included is an experimental second level soft reference cache. Rows in this cache are only garbage collected on low memory. By default the second level cache is disabled. To enable it, use the prefix <code>SOFT_</code>. Example\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;CACHE_TYPE\=SOFT_LRU</code>. The cache might not actually improve performance. If you plan to use it, please run your own test cases first. 
features_1611_p=\ To get information about page reads and writes, and the current caching algorithm in use, call <code>SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SETTINGS</code>. The number of pages read / written is listed.

history_1010_h2=History of this Database Engine
history_1011_p=\ The development of H2 was started in May 2004, but it was first published on December 14th 2005. The main author of H2, Thomas Mueller, is also the original developer of Hypersonic SQL. In 2001, he joined PointBase Inc. where he wrote PointBase Micro, a commercial Java SQL database. At that point, he had to discontinue Hypersonic SQL. The HSQLDB Group was formed to continued to work on the Hypersonic SQL codebase. The name H2 stands for Hypersonic 2, however H2 does not share code with Hypersonic SQL or HSQLDB. H2 is built from scratch. 
history_1012_h2=Why Java
history_1013_p=\ The main reasons to use a Java database are\: 
history_1014_li=Very simple to integrate in Java applications 
history_1015_li=Support for many different platforms 
history_1016_li=More secure than native applications (no buffer overflows) 
history_1017_li=User defined functions (or triggers) run very fast 
history_1018_li=Unicode support 
history_1019_p=\ Some think Java is too slow for low level operations, but this is no longer true. Garbage collection for example is now faster than manual memory management. 
history_1020_p=\ Developing Java code is faster than developing C or C++ code. When using Java, most time can be spent on improving the algorithms instead of porting the code to different platforms or doing memory management. Features such as Unicode and network libraries are already built-in. In Java, writing secure code is easier because buffer overflows can not occur. Features such as reflection can be used for randomized testing. 
history_1021_p=\ Java is future proof\: a lot of companies support Java. Java is now open source. 
history_1022_p=\ To increase the portability and ease of use, this software depends on very few libraries. Features that are not available in open source Java implementations (such as Swing) are not used, or only used for optional features.

jaqu_1011_h2=What is JaQu
jaqu_1012_p=\ Note\: This project is currently in maintenance mode. A friendly fork of JaQu is <a href\="http\://iciql.com">available under the name iciql</a>. 
jaqu_1013_p=\ JaQu stands for Java Query and allows to access databases using pure Java. JaQu provides a fluent interface (or internal DSL). JaQu is something like LINQ for Java (LINQ stands for "language integrated query" and is a Microsoft .NET technology). The following JaQu code\: 
jaqu_1014_p=\ stands for the SQL statement\: 
jaqu_1015_h2=Differences to Other Data Access Tools
jaqu_1016_p=\ Unlike SQL, JaQu can be easily integrated in Java applications. Because JaQu is pure Java, auto-complete in the IDE is supported. Type checking is performed by the compiler. JaQu fully protects against SQL injection. 
jaqu_1017_p=\ JaQu is meant as replacement for JDBC and SQL and not as much as a replacement for tools like Hibernate. With JaQu, you don't write SQL statements as strings. JaQu is much smaller and simpler than other persistence frameworks such as Hibernate, but it also does not provide all the features of those. Unlike iBatis and Hibernate, no XML or annotation based configuration is required; instead the configuration (if required at all) is done in pure Java, within the application. 
jaqu_1018_p=\ JaQu does not require or contain any data caching mechanism. Like JDBC and iBatis, JaQu provides full control over when and what SQL statements are executed (but without having to write SQL statements as strings). 
jaqu_1019_h3=Restrictions
jaqu_1020_p=\ Primitive types (eg. <code>boolean, int, long, double</code>) are not supported. Use <code>java.lang.Boolean, Integer, Long, Double</code> instead. 
jaqu_1021_h3=Why in Java?
jaqu_1022_p=\ Most applications are written in Java. Mixing Java and another language (for example Scala or Groovy) in the same application is complicated\: you would need to split the application and database code, and write adapter / wrapper code. 
jaqu_1023_h2=Current State
jaqu_1024_p=\ Currently, JaQu is only tested with the H2 database. The API may change in future versions. JaQu is not part of the h2 jar file, however the source code is included in H2, under\: 
jaqu_1025_code=src/test/org/h2/test/jaqu/*
jaqu_1026_li=\ (samples and tests) 
jaqu_1027_code=src/tools/org/h2/jaqu/*
jaqu_1028_li=\ (framework) 
jaqu_1029_h2=Building the JaQu Library
jaqu_1030_p=\ To create the JaQu jar file, run\: <code>build jarJaqu</code>. This will create the file <code>bin/h2jaqu.jar</code>. 
jaqu_1031_h2=Requirements
jaqu_1032_p=\ JaQu requires Java 6. Annotations are not need. Currently, JaQu is only tested with the H2 database engine, however in theory it should work with any database that supports the JDBC API. 
jaqu_1033_h2=Example Code
jaqu_1034_h2=Configuration
jaqu_1035_p=\ JaQu does not require any configuration when using the default field to column mapping. To define table indices, or if you want to map a class to a table with a different name, or a field to a column with another name, create a function called <code>define</code> in the data class. Example\: 
jaqu_1036_p=\ The method <code>define()</code> contains the mapping definition. It is called once when the class is used for the first time. Like annotations, the mapping is defined in the class itself. Unlike when using annotations, the compiler can check the syntax even for multi-column objects (multi-column indexes, multi-column primary keys and so on). Because the definition is written in Java, the configuration can be set at runtime, which is not possible using annotations. Unlike XML mapping configuration, the configuration is integrated in the class itself. 
jaqu_1037_h2=Natural Syntax
jaqu_1038_p=The plan is to support more natural (pure Java) syntax in conditions. To do that, the condition class is de-compiled to a SQL condition. A proof of concept decompiler is included (but it doesn't fully work yet; patches are welcome). The planned syntax is\: 
jaqu_1039_h2=Other Ideas
jaqu_1040_p=\ This project has just been started, and nothing is fixed yet. Some ideas are\: 
jaqu_1041_li=Support queries on collections (instead of using a database). 
jaqu_1042_li=Provide API level compatibility with JPA (so that JaQu can be used as an extension of JPA). 
jaqu_1043_li=Internally use a JPA implementation (for example Hibernate) instead of SQL directly. 
jaqu_1044_li=Use PreparedStatements and cache them.

license_1006_p=\ H2 is dual licensed and available under a modified version of the MPL 1.1 (<a href\="http\://www.mozilla.org/MPL">Mozilla Public License</a>) or under the (unmodified) EPL 1.0 (<a href\="http\://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php">Eclipse Public License</a>). The changes to the MPL are 
license_1007_em=underlined</em>. There is a license FAQ for both the MPL and the EPL, most of that is applicable to the H2 license as well. 
license_1008_li=You can use H2 for free. You can integrate it into your applications (including in commercial applications), and you can distribute it. 
license_1009_li=Files containing only your code are not covered by this license (it is 'commercial friendly'). 
license_1010_li=Modifications to the H2 source code must be published. 
license_1011_li=You don't need to provide the source code of H2 if you did not modify anything. 
license_1012_li=If you distribute a binary that includes H2, you need to add a disclaimer of liability - see the example below. 
license_1013_p=\ However, nobody is allowed to rename H2, modify it a little, and sell it as a database engine without telling the customers it is in fact H2. This happened to HSQLDB\: a company called 'bungisoft' copied HSQLDB, renamed it to 'RedBase', and tried to sell it, hiding the fact that it was in fact just HSQLDB. It seems 'bungisoft' does not exist any more, but you can use the <a href\="http\://www.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> and visit old web pages of <code>http\://www.bungisoft.com</code>. 
license_1014_p=\ About porting the source code to another language (for example C\# or C++)\: converted source code (even if done manually) stays under the same copyright and license as the original code. The copyright of the ported source code does not (automatically) go to the person who ported the code. 
license_1015_p=\ If you distribute a binary that includes H2, you need to add the license and a disclaimer of liability (as you should do for your own code). You should add a disclaimer for each open source libraries you use. For example, add a file <code>3rdparty_license.txt</code> in the directory where the jar files are, and list all open source libraries, each one with its license and disclaimer. For H2, a simple solution is to copy the following text below. You may also include a copy of the complete license.

license_1119_h2=Eclipse Public License - Version 1.0
license_1120_p=\ THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
license_1121_h3=1. DEFINITIONS
license_1122_p=\ "Contribution" means\: 
license_1123_p=\ a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and 
license_1124_p=\ b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor\: 
license_1125_p=\ i) changes to the Program, and 
license_1126_p=\ ii) additions to the Program; 
license_1127_p=\ where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which\: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 
license_1128_p=\ "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 
license_1129_p=\ "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

license_1131_p=\ "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. 
license_1132_h3=2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

license_1134_p=\ b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
license_1135_p=\ c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 
license_1136_p=\ d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
license_1137_h3=3. REQUIREMENTS
license_1138_p=\ A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that\: 
license_1139_p=\ a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 
license_1140_p=\ b) its license agreement\: 
license_1141_p=\ i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
license_1142_p=\ ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
license_1143_p=\ iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
license_1144_p=\ iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
license_1145_p=\ When the Program is made available in source code form\: 
license_1146_p=\ a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
license_1147_p=\ b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
license_1148_p=\ Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. 
license_1149_p=\ Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. 
license_1150_h3=4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
license_1151_p=\ Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must\: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
license_1152_p=\ For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 
license_1153_h3=5. NO WARRANTY
license_1154_p=\ EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

license_1157_h3=7. GENERAL
license_1158_p=\ If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
license_1159_p=\ If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 
license_1160_p=\ All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. 
license_1161_p=\ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner.

mvstore_1024_h2=Overview
mvstore_1025_p=\ The MVStore is work in progress, and is planned to be the next storage subsystem of H2. But it can also be used directly within an application, without using JDBC or SQL. 
mvstore_1026_li=MVStore stands for "multi-version store". 
mvstore_1027_li=Each store contains a number of maps that can be accessed using the <code>java.util.Map</code> interface. 
mvstore_1028_li=Both file-based persistence and in-memory operation are supported. 
mvstore_1029_li=It is intended to be fast, simple to use, and small. 
mvstore_1030_li=Old versions of the data can be read concurrently with all other operations. 
mvstore_1031_li=Transaction are supported (including concurrent transactions and 2-phase commit). 
mvstore_1032_li=The tool is very modular. It supports pluggable data types and serialization, pluggable storage (to a file, to off-heap memory), pluggable map implementations (B-tree, R-tree, concurrent B-tree currently), BLOB storage, and a file system abstraction to support encrypted files and zip files. 
mvstore_1033_h2=Example Code
mvstore_1034_p=\ The following sample code show how to use the tool\: 
mvstore_1035_h2=Store Builder
mvstore_1036_p=\ The <code>MVStore.Builder</code> provides a fluid interface to build a store if more complex configuration options are used. Example usage\: 
mvstore_1037_p=\ The list of available options is\: 
mvstore_1038_li=autoCommitBufferSize\: the size of the write buffer. 
mvstore_1039_li=autoCommitDisabled\: to disable auto-commit. 
mvstore_1040_li=backgroundExceptionHandler\: specify a handler for exceptions that could occur while writing in the background. 
mvstore_1041_li=cacheSize\: the cache size in MB. 
mvstore_1042_li=compressData\: compress the data when storing. 
mvstore_1043_li=encryptionKey\: the encryption key for file encryption. 
mvstore_1044_li=fileName\: the name of the file, for file based stores. 
mvstore_1045_li=fileStore\: the storage implementation to use. 
mvstore_1046_li=pageSplitSize\: the point where pages are split. 
mvstore_1047_li=readOnly\: open the file in read-only mode. 
mvstore_1048_h2=R-Tree
mvstore_1049_p=\ The <code>MVRTreeMap</code> is an R-tree implementation that supports fast spatial queries. It can be used as follows\: 
mvstore_1050_p=\ The default number of dimensions is 2. To use a different number of dimensions, call <code>new MVRTreeMap.Builder&lt;String&gt;().dimensions(3)</code>. The minimum number of dimensions is 1, the maximum is 255. 
mvstore_1051_h2=Features
mvstore_1052_h3=Maps
mvstore_1053_p=\ Each store contains a set of named maps. A map is sorted by key, and supports the common lookup operations, including access to the first and last key, iterate over some or all keys, and so on. 
mvstore_1054_p=\ Also supported, and very uncommon for maps, is fast index lookup\: the entries of the map can be be efficiently accessed like a random-access list (get the entry at the given index), and the index of a key can be calculated efficiently. That also means getting the median of two keys is very fast, and a range of keys can be counted very quickly. The iterator supports fast skipping. This is possible because internally, each map is organized in the form of a counted B+-tree. 
mvstore_1055_p=\ In database terms, a map can be used like a table, where the key of the map is the primary key of the table, and the value is the row. A map can also represent an index, where the key of the map is the key of the index, and the value of the map is the primary key of the table (for non-unique indexes, the key of the map must also contain the primary key). 
mvstore_1056_h3=Versions
mvstore_1057_p=\ A version is a snapshot of all the data of all maps at a given point in time. Creating a snapshot is fast\: only those pages that are changed after a snapshot are copied. This behavior is also called COW (copy on write). Rollback to an old version is supported. Old versions are readable until old data is purged. 
mvstore_1058_p=\ The following sample code show how to create a store, open a map, add some data, and access the current and an old version\: 
mvstore_1059_h3=Transactions
mvstore_1060_p=\ To support multiple concurrent open transactions, a transaction utility is included, the <code>TransactionStore</code>. The tool supports PostgreSQL style "read committed" transaction isolation with savepoints, two-phase commit, and other features typically available in a database. There is no limit on the size of a transaction (the log is written to disk for large or long running transactions). 
mvstore_1061_p=\ Internally, this utility stores the old versions of changed entries in a separate map, similar to a transaction log (except that entries of a closed transaction are removed, and the log is usually not stored for short transactions). For common use cases, the storage overhead of this utility is very small compared to the overhead of a regular transaction log. 
mvstore_1062_h3=In-Memory Performance and Usage
mvstore_1063_p=\ Performance of in-memory operations is comparable with <code>java.util.TreeMap</code>, but usually slower than <code>java.util.HashMap</code>. 
mvstore_1064_p=\ The memory overhead for large maps is slightly better than for the regular map implementations, but there is a higher overhead per map. For maps with less than about 25 entries, the regular map implementations need less memory. 
mvstore_1065_p=\ If no file name is specified, the store operates purely in memory. Except for persisting data, all features are supported in this mode (multi-versioning, index lookup, R-tree and so on). If a file name is specified, all operations occur in memory (with the same performance characteristics) until data is persisted. 
mvstore_1066_p=\ As in all map implementations, keys need to be immutable, that means changing the key object after an entry has been added is not allowed. If a file name is specified, the value may also not be changed after adding an entry, because it might be serialized (which could happen at any time when autocommit is enabled). 
mvstore_1067_h3=Pluggable Data Types
mvstore_1068_p=\ Serialization is pluggable. The default serialization currently supports many common data types, and uses Java serialization for other objects. The following classes are currently directly supported\: <code>Boolean, Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float, Double, BigInteger, BigDecimal, String, UUID, Date</code> and arrays (both primitive arrays and object arrays). 
mvstore_1069_p=\ Parameterized data types are supported (for example one could build a string data type that limits the length). 
mvstore_1070_p=\ The storage engine itself does not have any length limits, so that keys, values, pages, and chunks can be very big (as big as fits in memory). Also, there is no inherent limit to the number of maps and chunks. Due to using a log structured storage, there is no special case handling for large keys or pages. 
mvstore_1071_h3=BLOB Support
mvstore_1072_p=\ There is a mechanism that stores large binary objects by splitting them into smaller blocks. This allows to store objects that don't fit in memory. Streaming as well as random access reads on such objects are supported. This tool is written on top of the store, using only the map interface. 
mvstore_1073_h3=R-Tree and Pluggable Map Implementations
mvstore_1074_p=\ The map implementation is pluggable. In addition to the default <code>MVMap</code> (multi-version map), there is a map that supports concurrent write operations, and a multi-version R-tree map implementation for spatial operations. 
mvstore_1075_h3=Concurrent Operations and Caching
mvstore_1076_p=\ The default map implementation supports concurrent reads on old versions of the data. All such read operations can occur in parallel. Concurrent reads from the page cache, as well as concurrent reads from the file system are supported. Writing changes to the file can occur concurrently to modifying the data, as writing operates on a snapshot. 
mvstore_1077_p=\ Caching is done on the page level. The page cache is a concurrent LIRS cache, which should be resistant against scan operations. 
mvstore_1078_p=\ The default map implementation does not support concurrent modification operations on a map (the same as <code>HashMap</code> and <code>TreeMap</code>). Similar to those classes, the map tries to detect concurrent modification. 
mvstore_1079_p=\ With the <code>MVMapConcurrent</code> implementation, read operations even on the newest version can happen concurrently with all other operations, without risk of corruption. This comes with slightly reduced speed in single threaded mode, the same as with other <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> implementations. Write operations first read the relevant area from disk to memory (this can happen concurrently), and only then modify the data. The in-memory part of write operations is synchronized. 
mvstore_1080_p=\ For fully scalable concurrent write operations to a map (in-memory and to disk), the map could be split into multiple maps in different stores ('sharding'). The plan is to add such a mechanism later when needed. 
mvstore_1081_h3=Log Structured Storage
mvstore_1082_p=\ Internally, changes are buffered in memory, and once enough changes have accumulated, they are written in one continuous disk write operation. Compared to traditional database storage engines, this should improve write performance for file systems and storage systems that do not efficiently support small random writes, such as Btrfs, as well as SSDs. (According to a test, write throughput of a common SSD increases with write block size, until a block size of 2 MB, and then does not further increase.) By default, changes are automatically written when more than a number of pages are modified, and once every second in a background thread, even if only little data was changed. Changes can also be written explicitly by calling <code>commit()</code>. 
mvstore_1083_p=\ When storing, all changed pages are serialized, optionally compressed using the LZF algorithm, and written sequentially to a free area of the file. Each such change set is called a chunk. All parent pages of the changed B-trees are stored in this chunk as well, so that each chunk also contains the root of each changed map (which is the entry point for reading this version of the data). There is no separate index\: all data is stored as a list of pages. Per store, there is one additional map that contains the metadata (the list of maps, where the root page of each map is stored, and the list of chunks). 
mvstore_1084_p=\ There are usually two write operations per chunk\: one to store the chunk data (the pages), and one to update the file header (so it points to the latest chunk). If the chunk is appended at the end of the file, the file header is only written at the end of the chunk. There is no transaction log, no undo log, and there are no in-place updates (however, unused chunks are overwritten by default). 
mvstore_1085_p=\ Old data is kept for at least 45 seconds (configurable), so that there are no explicit sync operations required to guarantee data consistency. An application can also sync explicitly when needed. To reuse disk space, the chunks with the lowest amount of live data are compacted (the live data is stored again in the next chunk). To improve data locality and disk space usage, the plan is to automatically defragment and compact data. 
mvstore_1086_p=\ Compared to traditional storage engines (that use a transaction log, undo log, and main storage area), the log structured storage is simpler, more flexible, and typically needs less disk operations per change, as data is only written once instead of twice or 3 times, and because the B-tree pages are always full (they are stored next to each other) and can be easily compressed. But temporarily, disk space usage might actually be a bit higher than for a regular database, as disk space is not immediately re-used (there are no in-place updates). 
mvstore_1087_h3=Off-Heap and Pluggable Storage
mvstore_1088_p=\ Storage is pluggable. The default storage is to a single file (unless pure in-memory operation is used). 
mvstore_1089_p=\ An off-heap storage implementation is available. This storage keeps the data in the off-heap memory, meaning outside of the regular garbage collected heap. This allows to use very large in-memory stores without having to increase the JVM heap (which would increase Java garbage collection pauses a lot). Memory is allocated using <code>ByteBuffer.allocateDirect</code>. One chunk is allocated at a time (each chunk is usually a few MB large), so that allocation cost is low. To use the off-heap storage, call\: 
mvstore_1090_h3=File System Abstraction, File Locking and Online Backup
mvstore_1091_p=\ The file system is pluggable (the same file system abstraction is used as H2 uses). The file can be encrypted using a encrypting file system wrapper. Other file system implementations support reading from a compressed zip or jar file. The file system abstraction closely matches the Java 7 file system API. 
mvstore_1092_p=\ Each store may only be opened once within a JVM. When opening a store, the file is locked in exclusive mode, so that the file can only be changed from within one process. Files can be opened in read-only mode, in which case a shared lock is used. 
mvstore_1093_p=\ The persisted data can be backed up at any time, even during write operations (online backup). To do that, automatic disk space reuse needs to be first disabled, so that new data is always appended at the end of the file. Then, the file can be copied (the file handle is available to the application). It is recommended to use the utility class <code>FileChannelInputStream</code> to do this. For encrypted databases, both the encrypted (raw) file content, as well as the clear text content, can be backed up. 
mvstore_1094_h3=Encrypted Files
mvstore_1095_p=\ File encryption ensures the data can only be read with the correct password. Data can be encrypted as follows\: 
mvstore_1096_p=\ The following algorithms and settings are used\: 
mvstore_1097_li=The password char array is cleared after use, to reduce the risk that the password is stolen even if the attacker has access to the main memory. 
mvstore_1098_li=The password is hashed according to the PBKDF2 standard, using the SHA-256 hash algorithm. 
mvstore_1099_li=The length of the salt is 64 bits, so that an attacker can not use a pre-calculated password hash table (rainbow table). It is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator. 
mvstore_1100_li=To speed up opening an encrypted stores on Android, the number of PBKDF2 iterations is 10. The higher the value, the better the protection against brute-force password cracking attacks, but the slower is opening a file. 
mvstore_1101_li=The file itself is encrypted using the standardized disk encryption mode XTS-AES. Only little more than one AES-128 round per block is needed. 
mvstore_1102_h3=Tools
mvstore_1103_p=\ There is a tool (<code>MVStoreTool</code>) to dump the contents of a file. 
mvstore_1104_h3=Exception Handling
mvstore_1105_p=\ This tool does not throw checked exceptions. Instead, unchecked exceptions are thrown if needed. The error message always contains the version of the tool. The following exceptions can occur\: 
mvstore_1106_code=IllegalStateException
mvstore_1107_li=\ if a map was already closed or an IO exception occurred, for example if the file was locked, is already closed, could not be opened or closed, if reading or writing failed, if the file is corrupt, or if there is an internal error in the tool. For such exceptions, an error code is added to the exception so that the application can distinguish between different error cases. 
mvstore_1108_code=IllegalArgumentException
mvstore_1109_li=\ if a method was called with an illegal argument. 
mvstore_1110_code=UnsupportedOperationException
mvstore_1111_li=\ if a method was called that is not supported, for example trying to modify a read-only map. 
mvstore_1112_code=ConcurrentModificationException
mvstore_1113_li=\ if a map is modified concurrently. 
mvstore_1114_h3=Storage Engine for H2
mvstore_1115_p=\ The plan is to use the MVStore as the default storage engine for the H2 database in the future (supporting SQL, JDBC, transactions, MVCC, and so on). This is work in progress. To try it out, append <code>;MV_STORE\=TRUE</code> to the database URL. In general, performance should be similar than the current default storage engine (the page store). Even though it can be used with the default table level locking, it is recommended to use it together with the MVCC mode (to do that, append <code>;MVCC\=TRUE</code> to the database URL). 
mvstore_1116_h2=Similar Projects and Differences to Other Storage Engines
mvstore_1117_p=\ Unlike similar storage engines like LevelDB and Kyoto Cabinet, the MVStore is written in Java and can easily be embedded in a Java and Android application. 
mvstore_1118_p=\ The MVStore is somewhat similar to the Berkeley DB Java Edition because it is also written in Java, and is also a log structured storage, but the H2 license is more liberal. 
mvstore_1119_p=\ Like SQLite 3, the MVStore keeps all data in one file. Unlike SQLite 3, the MVStore uses is a log structured storage. The plan is to make the MVStore both easier to use as well as faster than SQLite 3. In a recent (very simple) test, the MVStore was about twice as fast as SQLite 3 on Android. 
mvstore_1120_p=\ The API of the MVStore is similar to MapDB (previously known as JDBM) from Jan Kotek, and some code is shared between MVStore and MapDB. However, unlike MapDB, the MVStore uses is a log structured storage. The MVStore does not have a record size limit. 
mvstore_1121_h2=Current State
mvstore_1122_p=\ The code is still experimental at this stage. The API as well as the behavior may partially change. Features may be added and removed (even though the main features will stay). 
mvstore_1123_h2=Requirements
mvstore_1124_p=\ The MVStore is included in the latest H2 jar file. 
mvstore_1125_p=\ There are no special requirements to use it. The MVStore should run on any JVM as well as on Android. 
mvstore_1126_p=\ To build just the MVStore (without the database engine), run\: 
mvstore_1127_p=\ This will create the file <code>bin/h2mvstore-1.3.175.jar</code> (about 130 KB).

The embedded mode of H2 is faster than the client-server mode because the per-statement overhead is greatly reduced.

performance_1242_h3=Benchmark Results and Comments
performance_1243_h4=H2
performance_1244_p=\ Version 1.2.137 (2010-06-06) was used for the test. For most operations, the performance of H2 is about the same as for HSQLDB. One situation where H2 is slow is large result sets, because they are buffered to disk if more than a certain number of records are returned. The advantage of buffering is\: there is no limit on the result set size. 
performance_1245_h4=HSQLDB
performance_1246_p=\ Version 2.0.0 was used for the test. Cached tables are used in this test (<code>hsqldb.default_table_type\=cached</code>), and the write delay is 1 second (<code>SET WRITE_DELAY 1</code>). 
performance_1247_h4=Derby
performance_1248_p=\ Version 10.6.1.0 was used for the test. Derby is clearly the slowest embedded database in this test. This seems to be a structural problem, because all operations are really slow. It will be hard for the developers of Derby to improve the performance to a reasonable level. A few problems have been identified\: leaving autocommit on is a problem for Derby. If it is switched off during the whole test, the results are about 20% better for Derby. Derby calls <code>FileChannel.force(false)</code>, but only twice per log file (not on each commit). Disabling this call improves performance for Derby by about 2%. Unlike H2, Derby does not call <code>FileDescriptor.sync()</code> on each checkpoint. Derby supports a testing mode (system property <code>derby.system.durability\=test</code>) where durability is disabled. According to the documentation, this setting should be used for testing only, as the database may not recover after a crash. Enabling this setting improves performance by a factor of 2.6 (embedded mode) or 1.4 (server mode). Even if enabled, Derby is still less than half as fast as H2 in default mode. 
performance_1249_h4=PostgreSQL
performance_1250_p=\ Version 8.4.4 was used for the test. The following options where changed in <code>postgresql.conf\: fsync \= off, commit_delay \= 1000</code>. PostgreSQL is run in server mode. The memory usage number is incorrect, because only the memory usage of the JDBC driver is measured. 
performance_1251_h4=MySQL
performance_1252_p=\ Version 5.1.47-community was used for the test. MySQL was run with the InnoDB backend. The setting <code>innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit</code> (found in the <code>my.ini / my.cnf</code> file) was set to 0. Otherwise (and by default), MySQL is slow (around 140 statements per second in this test) because it tries to flush the data to disk for each commit. For small transactions (when autocommit is on) this is really slow. But many use cases use small or relatively small transactions. Too bad this setting is not listed in the configuration wizard, and it always overwritten when using the wizard. You need to change this setting manually in the file <code>my.ini / my.cnf</code>, and then restart the service. The memory usage number is incorrect, because only the memory usage of the JDBC driver is measured. 
performance_1253_h4=Firebird
performance_1254_p=\ Firebird 1.5 (default installation) was tested, but the results are not published currently. It is possible to run the performance test with the Firebird database, and any information on how to configure Firebird for higher performance are welcome. 
performance_1255_h4=Why Oracle / MS SQL Server / DB2 are Not Listed
performance_1256_p=\ The license of these databases does not allow to publish benchmark results. This doesn't mean that they are fast. They are in fact quite slow, and need a lot of memory. But you will need to test this yourself. SQLite was not tested because the JDBC driver doesn't support transactions. 
performance_1257_h3=About this Benchmark
performance_1258_h4=How to Run
performance_1259_p=\ This test was as follows\: 
performance_1260_h4=Separate Process per Database
performance_1261_p=\ For each database, a new process is started, to ensure the previous test does not impact the current test. 
performance_1262_h4=Number of Connections
performance_1263_p=\ This is mostly a single-connection benchmark. BenchB uses multiple connections; the other tests use one connection. 
performance_1264_h4=Real-World Tests
performance_1265_p=\ Good benchmarks emulate real-world use cases. This benchmark includes 4 test cases\: BenchSimple uses one table and many small updates / deletes. BenchA is similar to the TPC-A test, but single connection / single threaded (see also\: www.tpc.org). BenchB is similar to the TPC-B test, using multiple connections (one thread per connection). BenchC is similar to the TPC-C test, but single connection / single threaded. 
performance_1266_h4=Comparing Embedded with Server Databases
performance_1267_p=\ This is mainly a benchmark for embedded databases (where the application runs in the same virtual machine as the database engine). However MySQL and PostgreSQL are not Java databases and cannot be embedded into a Java application. For the Java databases, both embedded and server modes are tested. 
performance_1268_h4=Test Platform
performance_1269_p=\ This test is run on Mac OS X 10.6. No virus scanner was used, and disk indexing was disabled. The JVM used is Sun JDK 1.6. 
performance_1270_h4=Multiple Runs
performance_1271_p=\ When a Java benchmark is run first, the code is not fully compiled and therefore runs slower than when running multiple times. A benchmark should always run the same test multiple times and ignore the first run(s). This benchmark runs three times, but only the last run is measured. 
performance_1272_h4=Memory Usage
performance_1273_p=\ It is not enough to measure the time taken, the memory usage is important as well. Performance can be improved by using a bigger cache, but the amount of memory is limited. HSQLDB tables are kept fully in memory by default; this benchmark uses 'disk based' tables for all databases. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to calculate the memory usage of PostgreSQL and MySQL, because they run in a different process than the test. This benchmark currently does not print memory usage of those databases. 
performance_1274_h4=Delayed Operations
performance_1275_p=\ Some databases delay some operations (for example flushing the buffers) until after the benchmark is run. This benchmark waits between each database tested, and each database runs in a different process (sequentially). 
performance_1276_h4=Transaction Commit / Durability
performance_1277_p=\ Durability means transaction committed to the database will not be lost. Some databases (for example MySQL) try to enforce this by default by calling <code>fsync()</code> to flush the buffers, but most hard drives don't actually flush all data. Calling the method slows down transaction commit a lot, but doesn't always make data durable. When comparing the results, it is important to think about the effect. Many database suggest to 'batch' operations when possible. This benchmark switches off autocommit when loading the data, and calls commit after each 1000 inserts. However many applications need 'short' transactions at runtime (a commit after each update). This benchmark commits after each update / delete in the simple benchmark, and after each business transaction in the other benchmarks. For databases that support delayed commits, a delay of one second is used. 
performance_1278_h4=Using Prepared Statements
performance_1279_p=\ Wherever possible, the test cases use prepared statements. 
performance_1280_h4=Currently Not Tested\: Startup Time
performance_1281_p=\ The startup time of a database engine is important as well for embedded use. This time is not measured currently. Also, not tested is the time used to create a database and open an existing database. Here, one (wrapper) connection is opened at the start, and for each step a new connection is opened and then closed. 
performance_1282_h2=PolePosition Benchmark
performance_1283_p=\ The PolePosition is an open source benchmark. The algorithms are all quite simple. It was developed / sponsored by db4o. This test was not run for a longer time, so please be aware that the results below are for older database versions (H2 version 1.1, HSQLDB 1.8, Java 1.4).

performance_1389_p=\ There are a few problems with the PolePosition test\: 
performance_1390_li=\ HSQLDB uses in-memory tables by default while H2 uses persistent tables. The HSQLDB version included in PolePosition does not support changing this, so you need to replace <code>poleposition-0.20/lib/hsqldb.jar</code> with a newer version (for example <code>hsqldb-1.8.0.7.jar</code>), and then use the setting <code>hsqldb.connecturl\=jdbc\:hsqldb\:file\:data/hsqldb/dbbench2;hsqldb.default_table_type\=cached;sql.enforce_size\=true</code> in the file <code>Jdbc.properties</code>. 
performance_1391_li=HSQLDB keeps the database open between tests, while H2 closes the database (losing all the cache). To change that, use the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:file\:data/h2/dbbench;DB_CLOSE_DELAY\=-1</code> 
performance_1392_li=The amount of cache memory is quite important, specially for the PolePosition test. Unfortunately, the PolePosition test does not take this into account. 
performance_1393_h2=Database Performance Tuning
performance_1394_h3=Keep Connections Open or Use a Connection Pool
performance_1395_p=\ If your application opens and closes connections a lot (for example, for each request), you should consider using a <a href\="tutorial.html\#connection_pool">connection pool</a>. Opening a connection using <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> is specially slow if the database is closed. By default the database is closed if the last connection is closed. 
performance_1396_p=\ If you open and close connections a lot but don't want to use a connection pool, consider keeping a 'sentinel' connection open for as long as the application runs, or use delayed database closing. See also <a href\="features.html\#closing_a_database">Closing a database</a>. 
performance_1397_h3=Use a Modern JVM
performance_1398_p=\ Newer JVMs are faster. Upgrading to the latest version of your JVM can provide a "free" boost to performance. Switching from the default Client JVM to the Server JVM using the <code>-server</code> command-line option improves performance at the cost of a slight increase in start-up time. 
performance_1399_h3=Virus Scanners
performance_1400_p=\ Some virus scanners scan files every time they are accessed. It is very important for performance that database files are not scanned for viruses. The database engine never interprets the data stored in the files as programs, that means even if somebody would store a virus in a database file, this would be harmless (when the virus does not run, it cannot spread). Some virus scanners allow to exclude files by suffix. Ensure files ending with <code>.db</code> are not scanned. 
performance_1401_h3=Using the Trace Options
performance_1402_p=\ If the performance hot spots are in the database engine, in many cases the performance can be optimized by creating additional indexes, or changing the schema. Sometimes the application does not directly generate the SQL statements, for example if an O/R mapping tool is used. To view the SQL statements and JDBC API calls, you can use the trace options. For more information, see <a href\="features.html\#trace_options">Using the Trace Options</a>. 
performance_1403_h3=Index Usage
performance_1404_p=\ This database uses indexes to improve the performance of <code>SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE</code>. If a column is used in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of a query, and if an index exists on this column, then the index can be used. Multi-column indexes are used if all or the first columns of the index are used. Both equality lookup and range scans are supported. Indexes are used to order result sets, but only if the condition uses the same index or no index at all. The results are sorted in memory if required. Indexes are created automatically for primary key and unique constraints. Indexes are also created for foreign key constraints, if required. For other columns, indexes need to be created manually using the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> statement. 
performance_1405_h3=How Data is Stored Internally
performance_1406_p=\ For persistent databases, if a table is created with a single column primary key of type <code>BIGINT, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT</code>, then the data of the table is organized in this way. This is sometimes also called a "clustered index" or "index organized table". 
performance_1407_p=\ H2 internally stores table data and indexes in the form of b-trees. Each b-tree stores entries as a list of unique keys (one or more columns) and data (zero or more columns). The table data is always organized in the form of a "data b-tree" with a single column key of type <code>long</code>. If a single column primary key of type <code>BIGINT, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT</code> is specified when creating the table (or just after creating the table, but before inserting any rows), then this column is used as the key of the data b-tree. If no primary key has been specified, if the primary key column is of another data type, or if the primary key contains more than one column, then a hidden auto-increment column of type <code>BIGINT</code> is added to the table, which is used as the key for the data b-tree. All other columns of the table are stored within the data area of this data b-tree (except for large <code>BLOB, CLOB</code> columns, which are stored externally). 
performance_1408_p=\ For each additional index, one new "index b-tree" is created. The key of this b-tree consists of the indexed columns, plus the key of the data b-tree. If a primary key is created after the table has been created, or if the primary key contains multiple column, or if the primary key is not of the data types listed above, then the primary key is stored in a new index b-tree. 
performance_1409_h3=Optimizer
performance_1410_p=\ This database uses a cost based optimizer. For simple and queries and queries with medium complexity (less than 7 tables in the join), the expected cost (running time) of all possible plans is calculated, and the plan with the lowest cost is used. For more complex queries, the algorithm first tries all possible combinations for the first few tables, and the remaining tables added using a greedy algorithm (this works well for most joins). Afterwards a genetic algorithm is used to test at most 2000 distinct plans. Only left-deep plans are evaluated. 
performance_1411_h3=Expression Optimization
performance_1412_p=\ After the statement is parsed, all expressions are simplified automatically if possible. Operations are evaluated only once if all parameters are constant. Functions are also optimized, but only if the function is constant (always returns the same result for the same parameter values). If the <code>WHERE</code> clause is always false, then the table is not accessed at all. 
performance_1413_h3=COUNT(*) Optimization
performance_1414_p=\ If the query only counts all rows of a table, then the data is not accessed. However, this is only possible if no <code>WHERE</code> clause is used, that means it only works for queries of the form <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table</code>. 
performance_1415_h3=Updating Optimizer Statistics / Column Selectivity
performance_1416_p=\ When executing a query, at most one index per join can be used. If the same table is joined multiple times, for each join only one index is used (the same index could be used for both joins, or each join could use a different index). Example\: for the query <code>SELECT * FROM TEST T1, TEST T2 WHERE T1.NAME\='A' AND T2.ID\=T1.ID</code>, two index can be used, in this case the index on NAME for T1 and the index on ID for T2. 
performance_1417_p=\ If a table has multiple indexes, sometimes more than one index could be used. Example\: if there is a table <code>TEST(ID, NAME, FIRSTNAME)</code> and an index on each column, then two indexes could be used for the query <code>SELECT * FROM TEST WHERE NAME\='A' AND FIRSTNAME\='B'</code>, the index on NAME or the index on FIRSTNAME. It is not possible to use both indexes at the same time. Which index is used depends on the selectivity of the column. The selectivity describes the 'uniqueness' of values in a column. A selectivity of 100 means each value appears only once, and a selectivity of 1 means the same value appears in many or most rows. For the query above, the index on NAME should be used if the table contains more distinct names than first names. 
performance_1418_p=\ The SQL statement <code>ANALYZE</code> can be used to automatically estimate the selectivity of the columns in the tables. This command should be run from time to time to improve the query plans generated by the optimizer. 
performance_1419_h3=In-Memory (Hash) Indexes
performance_1420_p=\ Using in-memory indexes, specially in-memory hash indexes, can speed up queries and data manipulation. 
performance_1421_p=In-memory indexes are automatically used for in-memory databases, but can also be created for persistent databases using <code>CREATE MEMORY TABLE</code>. In many cases, the rows itself will also be kept in-memory. Please note this may cause memory problems for large tables. 
performance_1422_p=\ In-memory hash indexes are backed by a hash table and are usually faster than regular indexes. However, hash indexes only supports direct lookup (<code>WHERE ID \= ?</code>) but not range scan (<code>WHERE ID &lt; ?</code>). To use hash indexes, use HASH as in\: <code>CREATE UNIQUE HASH INDEX</code> and <code>CREATE TABLE ...(ID INT PRIMARY KEY HASH,...)</code>. 
performance_1423_h3=Use Prepared Statements
performance_1424_p=\ If possible, use prepared statements with parameters. 
performance_1425_h3=Prepared Statements and IN(...)
performance_1426_p=\ Avoid generating SQL statements with a variable size IN(...) list. Instead, use a prepared statement with arrays as in the following example\: 
performance_1427_h3=Optimization Examples
performance_1428_p=\ See <code>src/test/org/h2/samples/optimizations.sql</code> for a few examples of queries that benefit from special optimizations built into the database. 
performance_1429_h3=Cache Size and Type
performance_1430_p=\ By default the cache size of H2 is quite small. Consider using a larger cache size, or enable the second level soft reference cache. See also <a href\="features.html\#cache_settings">Cache Settings</a>. 
performance_1431_h3=Data Types
performance_1432_p=\ Each data type has different storage and performance characteristics\: 
performance_1433_li=The <code>DECIMAL/NUMERIC</code> type is slower and requires more storage than the <code>REAL</code> and <code>DOUBLE</code> types. 
performance_1434_li=Text types are slower to read, write, and compare than numeric types and generally require more storage. 
performance_1435_li=See <a href\="advanced.html\#large_objects">Large Objects</a> for information on <code>BINARY</code> vs. <code>BLOB</code> and <code>VARCHAR</code> vs. <code>CLOB</code> performance. 
performance_1436_li=Parsing and formatting takes longer for the <code>TIME</code>, <code>DATE</code>, and <code>TIMESTAMP</code> types than the numeric types. 
performance_1437_code=SMALLINT/TINYINT/BOOLEAN
performance_1438_li=\ are not significantly smaller or faster to work with than <code>INTEGER</code> in most modes. 
performance_1439_h3=Sorted Insert Optimization
performance_1440_p=\ To reduce disk space usage and speed up table creation, an optimization for sorted inserts is available. When used, b-tree pages are split at the insertion point. To use this optimization, add <code>SORTED</code> before the <code>SELECT</code> statement\: 
performance_1441_h2=Using the Built-In Profiler
performance_1442_p=\ A very simple Java profiler is built-in. To use it, use the following template\: 
performance_1443_h2=Application Profiling
performance_1444_h3=Analyze First
performance_1445_p=\ Before trying to optimize performance, it is important to understand where the problem is (what part of the application is slow). Blind optimization or optimization based on guesses should be avoided, because usually it is not an efficient strategy. There are various ways to analyze an application. Sometimes two implementations can be compared using <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>. But this does not work for complex applications with many modules, and for memory problems. 
performance_1446_p=\ A simple way to profile an application is to use the built-in profiling tool of java. Example\: 
performance_1447_p=\ Unfortunately, it is only possible to profile the application from start to end. Another solution is to create a number of full thread dumps. To do that, first run <code>jps -l</code> to get the process id, and then run <code>jstack &lt;pid&gt;</code> or <code>kill -QUIT &lt;pid&gt;</code> (Linux) or press Ctrl+C (Windows). 
performance_1448_p=\ A simple profiling tool is included in H2. To use it, the application needs to be changed slightly. Example\: 
performance_1449_p=\ The profiler is built into the H2 Console tool, to analyze databases that open slowly. To use it, run the H2 Console, and then click on 'Test Connection'. Afterwards, click on "Test successful" and you get the most common stack traces, which helps to find out why it took so long to connect. You will only get the stack traces if opening the database took more than a few seconds. 
performance_1450_h2=Database Profiling
performance_1451_p=\ The <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool generates SQL statement statistics at the end of the SQL script file. The format used is similar to the profiling data generated when using <code>java -Xrunhprof</code>. For this to work, the trace level needs to be 2 or higher (<code>TRACE_LEVEL_FILE\=2</code>). The easiest way to set the trace level is to append the setting to the database URL, for example\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;TRACE_LEVEL_FILE\=2</code> or <code>jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost/~/test;TRACE_LEVEL_FILE\=2</code>. As an example, execute the the following script using the H2 Console\: 
performance_1452_p=\ After running the test case, convert the <code>.trace.db</code> file using the <code>ConvertTraceFile</code> tool. The trace file is located in the same directory as the database file. 
performance_1453_p=\ The generated file <code>test.sql</code> will contain the SQL statements as well as the following profiling data (results vary)\: 
performance_1454_h2=Statement Execution Plans
performance_1455_p=\ The SQL statement <code>EXPLAIN</code> displays the indexes and optimizations the database uses for a statement. The following statements support <code>EXPLAIN</code>\: <code>SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, INSERT</code>. The following query shows that the database uses the primary key index to search for rows\: 
performance_1456_p=\ For joins, the tables in the execution plan are sorted in the order they are processed. The following query shows the database first processes the table <code>INVOICE</code> (using the primary key). For each row, it will additionally check that the value of the column <code>AMOUNT</code> is larger than zero, and for those rows the database will search in the table <code>CUSTOMER</code> (using the primary key). The query plan contains some redundancy so it is a valid statement. 
performance_1457_h3=Displaying the Scan Count
performance_1458_code=EXPLAIN ANALYZE
performance_1459_p=\ additionally shows the scanned rows per table and pages read from disk per table or index. This will actually execute the query, unlike <code>EXPLAIN</code> which only prepares it. The following query scanned 1000 rows, and to do that had to read 85 pages from the data area of the table. Running the query twice will not list the pages read from disk, because they are now in the cache. The <code>tableScan</code> means this query doesn't use an index. 
performance_1460_p=\ The cache will prevent the pages are read twice. H2 reads all columns of the row unless only the columns in the index are read. Except for large CLOB and BLOB, which are not store in the table. 
performance_1461_h3=Special Optimizations
performance_1462_p=\ For certain queries, the database doesn't need to read all rows, or doesn't need to sort the result even if <code>ORDER BY</code> is used. 
performance_1463_p=\ For queries of the form <code>SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(ID), MAX(ID) FROM TEST</code>, the query plan includes the line <code>/* direct lookup */</code> if the data can be read from an index. 
performance_1464_p=\ For queries of the form <code>SELECT DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID FROM INVOICE</code>, the query plan includes the line <code>/* distinct */</code> if there is an non-unique or multi-column index on this column, and if this column has a low selectivity. 
performance_1465_p=\ For queries of the form <code>SELECT * FROM TEST ORDER BY ID</code>, the query plan includes the line <code>/* index sorted */</code> to indicate there is no separate sorting required. 
performance_1466_p=\ For queries of the form <code>SELECT * FROM TEST GROUP BY ID ORDER BY ID</code>, the query plan includes the line <code>/* group sorted */</code> to indicate there is no separate sorting required. 
performance_1467_h2=How Data is Stored and How Indexes Work
performance_1468_p=\ Internally, each row in a table is identified by a unique number, the row id. The rows of a table are stored with the row id as the key. The row id is a number of type long. If a table has a single column primary key of type <code>INT</code> or <code>BIGINT</code>, then the value of this column is the row id, otherwise the database generates the row id automatically. There is a (non-standard) way to access the row id\: using the <code>_ROWID_</code> pseudo-column\: 
performance_1469_p=\ The data is stored in the database as follows\: 
performance_1470_th=_ROWID_
performance_1471_th=FIRST_NAME
performance_1472_th=NAME
performance_1473_th=CITY
performance_1474_th=PHONE
performance_1475_td=1
performance_1476_td=John
performance_1477_td=Miller
performance_1478_td=Berne
performance_1479_td=123 456 789
performance_1480_td=2
performance_1481_td=Philip
performance_1482_td=Jones
performance_1483_td=Berne
performance_1484_td=123 012 345
performance_1485_p=\ Access by row id is fast because the data is sorted by this key. Please note the row id is not available until after the row was added (that means, it can not be used in computed columns or constraints). If the query condition does not contain the row id (and if no other index can be used), then all rows of the table are scanned. A table scan iterates over all rows in the table, in the order of the row id. To find out what strategy the database uses to retrieve the data, use <code>EXPLAIN SELECT</code>\: 
performance_1486_h3=Indexes
performance_1487_p=\ An index internally is basically just a table that contains the indexed column(s), plus the row id\: 
performance_1488_p=\ In the index, the data is sorted by the indexed columns. So this index contains the following data\: 
performance_1489_th=CITY
performance_1490_th=NAME
performance_1491_th=FIRST_NAME
performance_1492_th=_ROWID_
performance_1493_td=Berne
performance_1494_td=Jones
performance_1495_td=Philip
performance_1496_td=2
performance_1497_td=Berne
performance_1498_td=Miller
performance_1499_td=John
performance_1500_td=1
performance_1501_p=\ When the database uses an index to query the data, it searches the index for the given data, and (if required) reads the remaining columns in the main data table (retrieved using the row id). An index on city, name, and first name (multi-column index) allows to quickly search for rows when the city, name, and first name are known. If only the city and name, or only the city is known, then this index is also used (so creating an additional index on just the city is not needed). This index is also used when reading all rows, sorted by the indexed columns. However, if only the first name is known, then this index is not used\: 
performance_1502_p=\ If your application often queries the table for a phone number, then it makes sense to create an additional index on it\: 
performance_1503_p=\ This index contains the phone number, and the row id\: 
performance_1504_th=PHONE
performance_1505_th=_ROWID_
performance_1506_td=123 012 345
performance_1507_td=2
performance_1508_td=123 456 789
performance_1509_td=1
performance_1510_h3=Using Multiple Indexes
performance_1511_p=\ Within a query, only one index per logical table is used. Using the condition <code>PHONE \= '123 567 789' OR CITY \= 'Berne'</code> would use a table scan instead of first using the index on the phone number and then the index on the city. It makes sense to write two queries and combine then using <code>UNION</code>. In this case, each individual query uses a different index\: 
performance_1512_h2=Fast Database Import
performance_1513_p=\ To speed up large imports, consider using the following options temporarily\: 
performance_1514_code=SET LOG 0
performance_1515_li=\ (disabling the transaction log) 
performance_1516_code=SET CACHE_SIZE
performance_1517_li=\ (a large cache is faster) 
performance_1518_code=SET LOCK_MODE 0
performance_1519_li=\ (disable locking) 
performance_1520_code=SET UNDO_LOG 0
performance_1521_li=\ (disable the session undo log) 
performance_1522_p=\ These options can be set in the database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test;LOG\=0;CACHE_SIZE\=65536;LOCK_MODE\=0;UNDO_LOG\=0</code>. Most of those options are not recommended for regular use, that means you need to reset them after use. 
performance_1523_p=\ If you have to import a lot of rows, use a PreparedStatement or use CSV import. Please note that <code>CREATE TABLE(...) ... AS SELECT ...</code> is faster than <code>CREATE TABLE(...); INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</code>.

roadmap_1441_li=Issue 302\: Support optimizing queries with both inner and outer joins, as in\: select * from test a inner join test b on a.id\=b.id inner join o on o.id\=a.id where b.x\=1 (the optimizer should swap a and b here). See also TestNestedJoins, tag "swapInnerJoinTables". 
roadmap_1442_li=JaQu should support a DataSource and a way to create a Db object using a Connection (for multi-threaded usage with a connection pool). 
roadmap_1443_li=Move table to a different schema (rename table to a different schema), possibly using ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA ...; 
roadmap_1444_li=nioMapped file system\: automatically fall back to regular (non mapped) IO if there is a problem (out of memory exception for example).

roadmap_1453_li=Encrypted file system (use cipher text stealing so file length doesn't need to decrypt; 4 KB header per file, optional compatibility with current encrypted database files). 
roadmap_1454_li=Issue 229\: SELECT with simple OR tests uses tableScan when it could use indexes. 
roadmap_1455_li=GROUP BY queries should use a temporary table if there are too many rows.

roadmap_1498_li=Support NATURAL [ { LEFT | RIGHT } [ OUTER ] | INNER ] JOIN (Derby, Oracle) 
roadmap_1499_li=GROUP BY columnNumber (similar to ORDER BY columnNumber) (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite; not by HSQLDB and Derby). 
roadmap_1500_li=Sybase / MS SQL Server compatibility\: CONVERT(..) parameters are swapped. 
roadmap_1501_li=Index conditions\: WHERE AGE>1 should not scan through all rows with AGE\=1. 
roadmap_1502_li=PHP support\: H2 should support PDO, or test with PostgreSQL PDO.

roadmap_1504_li=Cluster\: allow using auto-increment and identity columns by ensuring executed in lock-step. 
roadmap_1505_li=MySQL compatibility\: index names only need to be unique for the given table. 
roadmap_1506_li=Issue 352\: constraints\: distinguish between 'no action' and 'restrict'. Currently, only restrict is supported, and 'no action' is internally mapped to 'restrict'. The database meta data returns 'restrict' in all cases. 
roadmap_1507_li=Oracle compatibility\: support MEDIAN aggregate function. 
roadmap_1508_li=Issue 348\: Oracle compatibility\: division should return a decimal result. 
roadmap_1509_li=Read rows on demand\: instead of reading the whole row, only read up to that column that is requested. Keep an pointer to the data area and the column id that is already read. 
roadmap_1510_li=Long running transactions\: log session id when detected.

roadmap_1517_h2=Not Planned
roadmap_1518_li=HSQLDB (did) support this\: select id i from test where i&lt;0 (other databases don't). Supporting it may break compatibility. 
roadmap_1519_li=String.intern (so that Strings can be compared with \=\=) will not be used because some VMs have problems when used extensively. 
roadmap_1520_li=In prepared statements, identifier names (table names and so on) can not be parameterized. Adding such a feature would complicate the source code without providing reasonable speedup, and would slow down regular prepared statements.

tutorial_1028_h2=Starting and Using the H2 Console
tutorial_1029_p=\ The H2 Console application lets you access a database using a browser. This can be a H2 database, or another database that supports the JDBC API. 
tutorial_1030_p=\ This is a client/server application, so both a server and a client (a browser) are required to run it. 
tutorial_1031_p=\ Depending on your platform and environment, there are multiple ways to start the H2 Console\: 
tutorial_1032_th=OS
tutorial_1033_th=Start
tutorial_1034_td=Windows
tutorial_1035_td=\ Click [Start], [All Programs], [H2], and [H2 Console (Command Line)]
tutorial_1036_td=\ An icon will be added to the system tray\: 
tutorial_1037_td=\ If you don't get the window and the system tray icon, then maybe Java is not installed correctly (in this case, try another way to start the application). A browser window should open and point to the login page at <code>http\://localhost\:8082</code>. 
tutorial_1038_td=Windows
tutorial_1039_td=\ Open a file browser, navigate to <code>h2/bin</code>, and double click on <code>h2.bat</code>.
tutorial_1040_td=\ A console window appears. If there is a problem, you will see an error message in this window. A browser window will open and point to the login page (URL\: <code>http\://localhost\:8082</code>). 
tutorial_1041_td=Any
tutorial_1042_td=\ Double click on the <code>h2*.jar</code> file. This only works if the <code>.jar</code> suffix is associated with Java. 
tutorial_1043_td=Any
tutorial_1044_td=\ Open a console window, navigate to the directory <code>h2/bin</code>, and type\: 
tutorial_1045_h3=Firewall
tutorial_1046_p=\ If you start the server, you may get a security warning from the firewall (if you have installed one). If you don't want other computers in the network to access the application on your machine, you can let the firewall block those connections. The connection from the local machine will still work. Only if you want other computers to access the database on this computer, you need allow remote connections in the firewall. 
tutorial_1047_p=\ It has been reported that when using Kaspersky 7.0 with firewall, the H2 Console is very slow when connecting over the IP address. A workaround is to connect using 'localhost'. 
tutorial_1048_p=\ A small firewall is already built into the server\: other computers may not connect to the server by default. To change this, go to 'Preferences' and select 'Allow connections from other computers'. 
tutorial_1049_h3=Testing Java
tutorial_1050_p=\ To find out which version of Java is installed, open a command prompt and type\: 
tutorial_1051_p=\ If you get an error message, you may need to add the Java binary directory to the path environment variable. 
tutorial_1052_h3=Error Message 'Port may be in use'
tutorial_1053_p=\ You can only start one instance of the H2 Console, otherwise you will get the following error message\: "The Web server could not be started. Possible cause\: another server is already running...". It is possible to start multiple console applications on the same computer (using different ports), but this is usually not required as the console supports multiple concurrent connections. 
tutorial_1054_h3=Using another Port
tutorial_1055_p=\ If the default port of the H2 Console is already in use by another application, then a different port needs to be configured. The settings are stored in a properties file. For details, see <a href\="\#console_settings">Settings of the H2 Console</a>. The relevant entry is <code>webPort</code>. 
tutorial_1056_p=\ If no port is specified for the TCP and PG servers, each service will try to listen on its default port. If the default port is already in use, a random port is used. 
tutorial_1057_h3=Connecting to the Server using a Browser
tutorial_1058_p=\ If the server started successfully, you can connect to it using a web browser. Javascript needs to be enabled. If you started the server on the same computer as the browser, open the URL <code>http\://localhost\:8082</code>. If you want to connect to the application from another computer, you need to provide the IP address of the server, for example\: <code>http\://192.168.0.2\:8082</code>. If you enabled SSL on the server side, the URL needs to start with <code>https\://</code>. 
tutorial_1059_h3=Multiple Concurrent Sessions
tutorial_1060_p=\ Multiple concurrent browser sessions are supported. As that the database objects reside on the server, the amount of concurrent work is limited by the memory available to the server application. 
tutorial_1061_h3=Login
tutorial_1062_p=\ At the login page, you need to provide connection information to connect to a database. Set the JDBC driver class of your database, the JDBC URL, user name, and password. If you are done, click [Connect]. 
tutorial_1063_p=\ You can save and reuse previously saved settings. The settings are stored in a properties file (see <a href\="\#console_settings">Settings of the H2 Console</a>). 
tutorial_1064_h3=Error Messages
tutorial_1065_p=\ Error messages in are shown in red. You can show/hide the stack trace of the exception by clicking on the message. 
tutorial_1066_h3=Adding Database Drivers
tutorial_1067_p=\ To register additional JDBC drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, HSQLDB,...), add the jar file names to the environment variables <code>H2DRIVERS</code> or <code>CLASSPATH</code>. Example (Windows)\: to add the HSQLDB JDBC driver <code>C\:\\Programs\\hsqldb\\lib\\hsqldb.jar</code>, set the environment variable <code>H2DRIVERS</code> to <code>C\:\\Programs\\hsqldb\\lib\\hsqldb.jar</code>. 
tutorial_1068_p=\ Multiple drivers can be set; entries need to be separated by <code>;</code> (Windows) or <code>\:</code> (other operating systems). Spaces in the path names are supported. The settings must not be quoted. 
tutorial_1069_h3=Using the H2 Console
tutorial_1070_p=\ The H2 Console application has three main panels\: the toolbar on top, the tree on the left, and the query/result panel on the right. The database objects (for example, tables) are listed on the left. Type a SQL command in the query panel and click [Run]. The result appears just below the command. 
tutorial_1071_h3=Inserting Table Names or Column Names
tutorial_1072_p=\ To insert table and column names into the script, click on the item in the tree. If you click on a table while the query is empty, then <code>SELECT * FROM ...</code> is added. While typing a query, the table that was used is expanded in the tree. For example if you type <code>SELECT * FROM TEST T WHERE T.</code> then the table TEST is expanded. 
tutorial_1073_h3=Disconnecting and Stopping the Application
tutorial_1074_p=\ To log out of the database, click [Disconnect] in the toolbar panel. However, the server is still running and ready to accept new sessions. 
tutorial_1075_p=\ To stop the server, right click on the system tray icon and select [Exit]. If you don't have the system tray icon, navigate to [Preferences] and click [Shutdown], press [Ctrl]+[C] in the console where the server was started (Windows), or close the console window. 
tutorial_1076_h2=Special H2 Console Syntax
tutorial_1077_p=\ The H2 Console supports a few built-in commands. Those are interpreted within the H2 Console, so they work with any database. Built-in commands need to be at the beginning of a statement (before any remarks), otherwise they are not parsed correctly. If in doubt, add <code>;</code> before the command. 
tutorial_1078_th=Command(s)
tutorial_1079_th=Description

tutorial_1122_h2=Settings of the H2 Console
tutorial_1123_p=\ The settings of the H2 Console are stored in a configuration file called <code>.h2.server.properties</code> in you user home directory. For Windows installations, the user home directory is usually <code>C\:\\Documents and Settings\\[username]</code> or <code>C\:\\Users\\[username]</code>. The configuration file contains the settings of the application and is automatically created when the H2 Console is first started. Supported settings are\: 
tutorial_1124_code=webAllowOthers
tutorial_1125_li=\: allow other computers to connect. 
tutorial_1126_code=webPort
tutorial_1127_li=\: the port of the H2 Console 
tutorial_1128_code=webSSL
tutorial_1129_li=\: use encrypted (HTTPS) connections. 
tutorial_1130_p=\ In addition to those settings, the properties of the last recently used connection are listed in the form <code>&lt;number&gt;\=&lt;name&gt;|&lt;driver&gt;|&lt;url&gt;|&lt;user&gt;</code> using the escape character <code>\\</code>. Example\: <code>1\=Generic H2 (Embedded)|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\\\:h2\\\:~/test|sa</code> 
tutorial_1131_h2=Connecting to a Database using JDBC
tutorial_1132_p=\ To connect to a database, a Java application first needs to load the database driver, and then get a connection. A simple way to do that is using the following code\: 
tutorial_1133_p=\ This code first loads the driver (<code>Class.forName(...)</code>) and then opens a connection (using <code>DriverManager.getConnection()</code>). The driver name is <code>"org.h2.Driver"</code>. The database URL always needs to start with <code>jdbc\:h2\:</code> to be recognized by this database. The second parameter in the <code>getConnection()</code> call is the user name (<code>sa</code> for System Administrator in this example). The third parameter is the password. In this database, user names are not case sensitive, but passwords are. 
tutorial_1134_h2=Creating New Databases
tutorial_1135_p=\ By default, if the database specified in the URL does not yet exist, a new (empty) database is created automatically. The user that created the database automatically becomes the administrator of this database. 
tutorial_1136_p=\ Auto-creating new database can be disabled, see <a href\="features.html\#database_only_if_exists">Opening a Database Only if it Already Exists</a>. 
tutorial_1137_h2=Using the Server
tutorial_1138_p=\ H2 currently supports three server\: a web server (for the H2 Console), a TCP server (for client/server connections) and an PG server (for PostgreSQL clients). Please note that only the web server supports browser connections. The servers can be started in different ways, one is using the <code>Server</code> tool. Starting the server doesn't open a database - databases are opened as soon as a client connects. 
tutorial_1139_h3=Starting the Server Tool from Command Line
tutorial_1140_p=\ To start the <code>Server</code> tool from the command line with the default settings, run\: 
tutorial_1141_p=\ This will start the tool with the default options. To get the list of options and default values, run\: 
tutorial_1142_p=\ There are options available to use other ports, and start or not start parts. 
tutorial_1143_h3=Connecting to the TCP Server
tutorial_1144_p=\ To remotely connect to a database using the TCP server, use the following driver and database URL\: 
tutorial_1145_li=JDBC driver class\: <code>org.h2.Driver</code> 
tutorial_1146_li=Database URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:tcp\://localhost/~/test</code> 
tutorial_1147_p=\ For details about the database URL, see also in Features. Please note that you can't connection with a web browser to this URL. You can only connect using a H2 client (over JDBC). 
tutorial_1148_h3=Starting the TCP Server within an Application
tutorial_1149_p=\ Servers can also be started and stopped from within an application. Sample code\: 
tutorial_1150_h3=Stopping a TCP Server from Another Process
tutorial_1151_p=\ The TCP server can be stopped from another process. To stop the server from the command line, run\: 
tutorial_1152_p=\ To stop the server from a user application, use the following code\: 
tutorial_1153_p=\ This function will only stop the TCP server. If other server were started in the same process, they will continue to run. To avoid recovery when the databases are opened the next time, all connections to the databases should be closed before calling this method. To stop a remote server, remote connections must be enabled on the server. Shutting down a TCP server can be protected using the option <code>-tcpPassword</code> (the same password must be used to start and stop the TCP server). 
tutorial_1154_h2=Using Hibernate
tutorial_1155_p=\ This database supports Hibernate version 3.1 and newer. You can use the HSQLDB Dialect, or the native H2 Dialect. Unfortunately the H2 Dialect included in some old versions of Hibernate was buggy. A <a href\="http\://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3401">patch for Hibernate</a> has been submitted and is now applied. You can rename it to <code>H2Dialect.java</code> and include this as a patch in your application, or upgrade to a version of Hibernate where this is fixed. 
tutorial_1156_p=\ When using Hibernate, try to use the <code>H2Dialect</code> if possible. When using the <code>H2Dialect</code>, compatibility modes such as <code>MODE\=MySQL</code> are not supported. When using such a compatibility mode, use the Hibernate dialect for the corresponding database instead of the <code>H2Dialect</code>; but please note H2 does not support all features of all databases. 
tutorial_1157_h2=Using TopLink and Glassfish
tutorial_1158_p=\ To use H2 with Glassfish (or Sun AS), set the Datasource Classname to <code>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</code>. You can set this in the GUI at Application Server - Resources - JDBC - Connection Pools, or by editing the file <code>sun-resources.xml</code>\: at element <code>jdbc-connection-pool</code>, set the attribute <code>datasource-classname</code> to <code>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</code>. 
tutorial_1159_p=\ The H2 database is compatible with HSQLDB and PostgreSQL. To take advantage of H2 specific features, use the <code>H2Platform</code>. The source code of this platform is included in H2 at <code>src/tools/oracle/toplink/essentials/platform/database/DatabasePlatform.java.txt</code>. You will need to copy this file to your application, and rename it to .java. To enable it, change the following setting in persistence.xml\: 
tutorial_1160_p=\ In old versions of Glassfish, the property name is <code>toplink.platform.class.name</code>. 
tutorial_1161_p=\ To use H2 within Glassfish, copy the h2*.jar to the directory <code>glassfish/glassfish/lib</code>. 
tutorial_1162_h2=Using EclipseLink
tutorial_1163_p=\ To use H2 in EclipseLink, use the platform class <code>org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.H2Platform</code>. If this platform is not available in your version of EclipseLink, you can use the OraclePlatform instead in many case. See also <a href\="http\://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Development/Incubator/Extensions/H2Platform">H2Platform</a>. 
tutorial_1164_h2=Using Apache ActiveMQ
tutorial_1165_p=\ When using H2 as the backend database for Apache ActiveMQ, please use the <code>TransactDatabaseLocker</code> instead of the default locking mechanism. Otherwise the database file will grow without bounds. The problem is that the default locking mechanism uses an uncommitted <code>UPDATE</code> transaction, which keeps the transaction log from shrinking (causes the database file to grow). Instead of using an <code>UPDATE</code> statement, the <code>TransactDatabaseLocker</code> uses <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code> which is not problematic. To use it, change the ApacheMQ configuration element <code>&lt;jdbcPersistenceAdapter&gt;</code> element, property <code>databaseLocker\="org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.TransactDatabaseLocker"</code>. However, using the MVCC mode will again result in the same problem. Therefore, please do not use the MVCC mode in this case. Another (more dangerous) solution is to set <code>useDatabaseLock</code> to false. 
tutorial_1166_h2=Using H2 within NetBeans
tutorial_1167_p=\ The project <a href\="http\://kenai.com/projects/nbh2">H2 Database Engine Support For NetBeans</a> allows you to start and stop the H2 server from within the IDE. 
tutorial_1168_p=\ There is a known issue when using the Netbeans SQL Execution Window\: before executing a query, another query in the form <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &lt;query&gt;</code> is run. This is a problem for queries that modify state, such as <code>SELECT SEQ.NEXTVAL</code>. In this case, two sequence values are allocated instead of just one. 
tutorial_1169_h2=Using H2 with jOOQ
tutorial_1170_p=\ jOOQ adds a thin layer on top of JDBC, allowing for type-safe SQL construction, including advanced SQL, stored procedures and advanced data types. jOOQ takes your database schema as a base for code generation. If this is your example schema\: 
tutorial_1171_p=\ then run the jOOQ code generator on the command line using this command\: 
tutorial_1172_p=\ ...where <code>codegen.xml</code> is on the classpath and contains this information 
tutorial_1173_p=\ Using the generated source, you can query the database as follows\: 
tutorial_1174_p=\ See more details on <a href\="http\://www.jooq.org">jOOQ Homepage</a> and in the <a href\="http\://www.jooq.org/tutorial.php">jOOQ Tutorial</a> 
tutorial_1175_h2=Using Databases in Web Applications
tutorial_1176_p=\ There are multiple ways to access a database from within web applications. Here are some examples if you use Tomcat or JBoss. 
tutorial_1177_h3=Embedded Mode
tutorial_1178_p=\ The (currently) simplest solution is to use the database in the embedded mode, that means open a connection in your application when it starts (a good solution is using a Servlet Listener, see below), or when a session starts. A database can be accessed from multiple sessions and applications at the same time, as long as they run in the same process. Most Servlet Containers (for example Tomcat) are just using one process, so this is not a problem (unless you run Tomcat in clustered mode). Tomcat uses multiple threads and multiple classloaders. If multiple applications access the same database at the same time, you need to put the database jar in the <code>shared/lib</code> or <code>server/lib</code> directory. It is a good idea to open the database when the web application starts, and close it when the web application stops. If using multiple applications, only one (any) of them needs to do that. In the application, an idea is to use one connection per Session, or even one connection per request (action). Those connections should be closed after use if possible (but it's not that bad if they don't get closed). 
tutorial_1179_h3=Server Mode
tutorial_1180_p=\ The server mode is similar, but it allows you to run the server in another process. 
tutorial_1181_h3=Using a Servlet Listener to Start and Stop a Database
tutorial_1182_p=\ Add the h2*.jar file to your web application, and add the following snippet to your web.xml file (between the <code>context-param</code> and the <code>filter</code> section)\: 
tutorial_1183_p=\ For details on how to access the database, see the file <code>DbStarter.java</code>. By default this tool opens an embedded connection using the database URL <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test</code>, user name <code>sa</code>, and password <code>sa</code>. If you want to use this connection within your servlet, you can access as follows\: 
tutorial_1184_code=DbStarter
tutorial_1185_p=\ can also start the TCP server, however this is disabled by default. To enable it, use the parameter <code>db.tcpServer</code> in the file <code>web.xml</code>. Here is the complete list of options. These options need to be placed between the <code>description</code> tag and the <code>listener</code> / <code>filter</code> tags\: 
tutorial_1186_p=\ When the web application is stopped, the database connection will be closed automatically. If the TCP server is started within the <code>DbStarter</code>, it will also be stopped automatically. 
tutorial_1187_h3=Using the H2 Console Servlet
tutorial_1188_p=\ The H2 Console is a standalone application and includes its own web server, but it can be used as a servlet as well. To do that, include the the <code>h2*.jar</code> file in your application, and add the following configuration to your <code>web.xml</code>\: 
tutorial_1189_p=\ For details, see also <code>src/tools/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. 
tutorial_1190_p=\ To create a web application with just the H2 Console, run the following command\: 
tutorial_1191_h2=Android
tutorial_1192_p=\ You can use this database on an Android device (using the Dalvik VM) instead of or in addition to SQLite. So far, only very few tests and benchmarks were run, but it seems that performance is similar to SQLite, except for opening and closing a database, which is not yet optimized in H2 (H2 takes about 0.2 seconds, and SQLite about 0.02 seconds). Read operations seem to be a bit faster than SQLite, and write operations seem to be slower. So far, only very few tests have been run, and everything seems to work as expected. Fulltext search was not yet tested, however the native fulltext search should work. 
tutorial_1193_p=\ Reasons to use H2 instead of SQLite are\: 
tutorial_1194_li=Full Unicode support including UPPER() and LOWER(). 
tutorial_1195_li=Streaming API for BLOB and CLOB data. 
tutorial_1196_li=Fulltext search. 
tutorial_1197_li=Multiple connections. 
tutorial_1198_li=User defined functions and triggers. 
tutorial_1199_li=Database file encryption. 
tutorial_1200_li=Reading and writing CSV files (this feature can be used outside the database as well). 
tutorial_1201_li=Referential integrity and check constraints. 
tutorial_1202_li=Better data type and SQL support. 
tutorial_1203_li=In-memory databases, read-only databases, linked tables. 
tutorial_1204_li=Better compatibility with other databases which simplifies porting applications. 
tutorial_1205_li=Possibly better performance (so far for read operations). 
tutorial_1206_li=Server mode (accessing a database on a different machine over TCP/IP). 
tutorial_1207_p=\ Currently only the JDBC API is supported (it is planned to support the Android database API in future releases). Both the regular H2 jar file and the smaller <code>h2small-*.jar</code> can be used. To create the smaller jar file, run the command <code>./build.sh jarSmall</code> (Linux / Mac OS) or <code>build.bat jarSmall</code> (Windows). 
tutorial_1208_p=\ The database files needs to be stored in a place that is accessible for the application. Example\: 
tutorial_1209_p=\ Limitations\: Using a connection pool is currently not supported, because the required <code>javax.sql.</code> classes are not available on Android. 
tutorial_1210_h2=CSV (Comma Separated Values) Support
tutorial_1211_p=\ The CSV file support can be used inside the database using the functions <code>CSVREAD</code> and <code>CSVWRITE</code>, or it can be used outside the database as a standalone tool. 
tutorial_1212_h3=Reading a CSV File from Within a Database
tutorial_1213_p=\ A CSV file can be read using the function <code>CSVREAD</code>. Example\: 
tutorial_1214_p=\ Please note for performance reason, <code>CSVREAD</code> should not be used inside a join. Instead, import the data first (possibly into a temporary table), create the required indexes if necessary, and then query this table. 
tutorial_1215_h3=Importing Data from a CSV File
tutorial_1216_p=\ A fast way to load or import data (sometimes called 'bulk load') from a CSV file is to combine table creation with import. Optionally, the column names and data types can be set when creating the table. Another option is to use <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code>. 
tutorial_1217_h3=Writing a CSV File from Within a Database
tutorial_1218_p=\ The built-in function <code>CSVWRITE</code> can be used to create a CSV file from a query. Example\: 
tutorial_1219_h3=Writing a CSV File from a Java Application
tutorial_1220_p=\ The <code>Csv</code> tool can be used in a Java application even when not using a database at all. Example\: 
tutorial_1221_h3=Reading a CSV File from a Java Application
tutorial_1222_p=\ It is possible to read a CSV file without opening a database. Example\: 
tutorial_1223_h2=Upgrade, Backup, and Restore
tutorial_1224_h3=Database Upgrade
tutorial_1225_p=\ The recommended way to upgrade from one version of the database engine to the next version is to create a backup of the database (in the form of a SQL script) using the old engine, and then execute the SQL script using the new engine. 
tutorial_1226_h3=Backup using the Script Tool
tutorial_1227_p=\ The recommended way to backup a database is to create a compressed SQL script file. This will result in a small, human readable, and database version independent backup. Creating the script will also verify the checksums of the database file. The <code>Script</code> tool is ran as follows\: 
tutorial_1228_p=\ It is also possible to use the SQL command <code>SCRIPT</code> to create the backup of the database. For more information about the options, see the SQL command <code>SCRIPT</code>. The backup can be done remotely, however the file will be created on the server side. The built in FTP server could be used to retrieve the file from the server. 
tutorial_1229_h3=Restore from a Script
tutorial_1230_p=\ To restore a database from a SQL script file, you can use the <code>RunScript</code> tool\: 
tutorial_1231_p=\ For more information about the options, see the SQL command <code>RUNSCRIPT</code>. The restore can be done remotely, however the file needs to be on the server side. The built in FTP server could be used to copy the file to the server. It is also possible to use the SQL command <code>RUNSCRIPT</code> to execute a SQL script. SQL script files may contain references to other script files, in the form of <code>RUNSCRIPT</code> commands. However, when using the server mode, the references script files need to be available on the server side. 
tutorial_1232_h3=Online Backup
tutorial_1233_p=\ The <code>BACKUP</code> SQL statement and the <code>Backup</code> tool both create a zip file with the database file. However, the contents of this file are not human readable. 
tutorial_1234_p=\ The resulting backup is transactionally consistent, meaning the consistency and atomicity rules apply. 
tutorial_1235_p=\ The <code>Backup</code> tool (<code>org.h2.tools.Backup</code>) can not be used to create a online backup; the database must not be in use while running this program. 
tutorial_1236_p=\ Creating a backup by copying the database files while the database is running is not supported, except if the file systems support creating snapshots. With other file systems, it can't be guaranteed that the data is copied in the right order. 
tutorial_1237_h2=Command Line Tools
tutorial_1238_p=\ This database comes with a number of command line tools. To get more information about a tool, start it with the parameter '-?', for example\: 
tutorial_1239_p=\ The command line tools are\: 
tutorial_1240_code=Backup
tutorial_1241_li=\ creates a backup of a database. 
tutorial_1242_code=ChangeFileEncryption
tutorial_1243_li=\ allows changing the file encryption password or algorithm of a database. 
tutorial_1244_code=Console
tutorial_1245_li=\ starts the browser based H2 Console. 
tutorial_1246_code=ConvertTraceFile
tutorial_1247_li=\ converts a .trace.db file to a Java application and SQL script. 
tutorial_1248_code=CreateCluster
tutorial_1249_li=\ creates a cluster from a standalone database. 
tutorial_1250_code=DeleteDbFiles
tutorial_1251_li=\ deletes all files belonging to a database. 
tutorial_1252_code=Recover
tutorial_1253_li=\ helps recovering a corrupted database. 
tutorial_1254_code=Restore
tutorial_1255_li=\ restores a backup of a database. 
tutorial_1256_code=RunScript
tutorial_1257_li=\ runs a SQL script against a database. 
tutorial_1258_code=Script
tutorial_1259_li=\ allows converting a database to a SQL script for backup or migration. 
tutorial_1260_code=Server
tutorial_1261_li=\ is used in the server mode to start a H2 server. 
tutorial_1262_code=Shell
tutorial_1263_li=\ is a command line database tool. 
tutorial_1264_p=\ The tools can also be called from an application by calling the main or another public method. For details, see the Javadoc documentation. 
tutorial_1265_h2=The Shell Tool
tutorial_1266_p=\ The Shell tool is a simple interactive command line tool. To start it, type\: 
tutorial_1267_p=\ You will be asked for a database URL, JDBC driver, user name, and password. The connection setting can also be set as command line parameters. After connecting, you will get the list of options. The built-in commands don't need to end with a semicolon, but SQL statements are only executed if the line ends with a semicolon <code>;</code>. This allows to enter multi-line statements\: 
tutorial_1268_p=\ By default, results are printed as a table. For results with many column, consider using the list mode\: 
tutorial_1269_h2=Using OpenOffice Base
tutorial_1270_p=\ OpenOffice.org Base supports database access over the JDBC API. To connect to a H2 database using OpenOffice Base, you first need to add the JDBC driver to OpenOffice. The steps to connect to a H2 database are\: 
tutorial_1271_li=Start OpenOffice Writer, go to [Tools], [Options] 
tutorial_1272_li=Make sure you have selected a Java runtime environment in OpenOffice.org / Java 
tutorial_1273_li=Click [Class Path...], [Add Archive...] 
tutorial_1274_li=Select your h2 jar file (location is up to you, could be wherever you choose) 
tutorial_1275_li=Click [OK] (as much as needed), stop OpenOffice (including the Quickstarter) 
tutorial_1276_li=Start OpenOffice Base 
tutorial_1277_li=Connect to an existing database; select [JDBC]; [Next] 
tutorial_1278_li=Example datasource URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test</code> 
tutorial_1279_li=JDBC driver class\: <code>org.h2.Driver</code> 
tutorial_1280_p=\ Now you can access the database stored in the current users home directory. 
tutorial_1281_p=\ To use H2 in NeoOffice (OpenOffice without X11)\: 
tutorial_1282_li=In NeoOffice, go to [NeoOffice], [Preferences] 
tutorial_1283_li=Look for the page under [NeoOffice], [Java] 
tutorial_1284_li=Click [Class Path], [Add Archive...] 
tutorial_1285_li=Select your h2 jar file (location is up to you, could be wherever you choose) 
tutorial_1286_li=Click [OK] (as much as needed), restart NeoOffice. 
tutorial_1287_p=\ Now, when creating a new database using the "Database Wizard" \: 
tutorial_1288_li=Click [File], [New], [Database]. 
tutorial_1289_li=Select [Connect to existing database] and the select [JDBC]. Click next. 
tutorial_1290_li=Example datasource URL\: <code>jdbc\:h2\:~/test</code> 
tutorial_1291_li=JDBC driver class\: <code>org.h2.Driver</code> 
tutorial_1292_p=\ Another solution to use H2 in NeoOffice is\: 
tutorial_1293_li=Package the h2 jar within an extension package 
tutorial_1294_li=Install it as a Java extension in NeoOffice 
tutorial_1295_p=\ This can be done by create it using the NetBeans OpenOffice plugin. See also <a href\="http\://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Extensions_development_java">Extensions Development</a>. 
tutorial_1296_h2=Java Web Start / JNLP
tutorial_1297_p=\ When using Java Web Start / JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol), permissions tags must be set in the .jnlp file, and the application .jar file must be signed. Otherwise, when trying to write to the file system, the following exception will occur\: <code>java.security.AccessControlException</code>\: access denied (<code>java.io.FilePermission ... read</code>). Example permission tags\: 
tutorial_1298_h2=Using a Connection Pool
tutorial_1299_p=\ For H2, opening a connection is fast if the database is already open. Still, using a connection pool improves performance if you open and close connections a lot. A simple connection pool is included in H2. It is based on the <a href\="http\://www.source-code.biz/snippets/java/8.htm">Mini Connection Pool Manager</a> from Christian d'Heureuse. There are other, more complex, open source connection pools available, for example the <a href\="http\://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/">Apache Commons DBCP</a>. For H2, it is about twice as faster to get a connection from the built-in connection pool than to get one using <code>DriverManager.getConnection()</code>.The build-in connection pool is used as follows\: 
tutorial_1300_h2=Fulltext Search
tutorial_1301_p=\ H2 includes two fulltext search implementations. One is using Apache Lucene, and the other (the native implementation) stores the index data in special tables in the database. 
tutorial_1302_h3=Using the Native Fulltext Search
tutorial_1303_p=\ To initialize, call\: 
tutorial_1304_p=\ You need to initialize it in each database where you want to use it. Afterwards, you can create a fulltext index for a table using\: 
tutorial_1305_p=\ PUBLIC is the schema name, TEST is the table name. The list of column names (comma separated) is optional, in this case all columns are indexed. The index is updated in realtime. To search the index, use the following query\: 
tutorial_1306_p=\ This will produce a result set that contains the query needed to retrieve the data\: 
tutorial_1307_p=\ To drop an index on a table\: 
tutorial_1308_p=\ To get the raw data, use <code>FT_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0);</code>. The result contains the columns <code>SCHEMA</code> (the schema name), <code>TABLE</code> (the table name), <code>COLUMNS</code> (an array of column names), and <code>KEYS</code> (an array of objects). To join a table, use a join as in\: <code>SELECT T.* FROM FT_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0) FT, TEST T WHERE FT.TABLE\='TEST' AND T.ID\=FT.KEYS[0];</code> 
tutorial_1309_p=\ You can also call the index from within a Java application\: 
tutorial_1310_h3=Using the Lucene Fulltext Search
tutorial_1311_p=\ To use the Lucene full text search, you need the Lucene library in the classpath. Currently Apache Lucene version 2.x is used by default for H2 version 1.2.x, and Lucene version 3.x is used by default for H2 version 1.3.x. How to do that depends on the application; if you use the H2 Console, you can add the Lucene jar file to the environment variables <code>H2DRIVERS</code> or <code>CLASSPATH</code>. To initialize the Lucene fulltext search in a database, call\: 
tutorial_1312_p=\ You need to initialize it in each database where you want to use it. Afterwards, you can create a full text index for a table using\: 
tutorial_1313_p=\ PUBLIC is the schema name, TEST is the table name. The list of column names (comma separated) is optional, in this case all columns are indexed. The index is updated in realtime. To search the index, use the following query\: 
tutorial_1314_p=\ This will produce a result set that contains the query needed to retrieve the data\: 
tutorial_1315_p=\ To drop an index on a table (be warned that this will re-index all of the full-text indices for the entire database)\: 
tutorial_1316_p=\ To get the raw data, use <code>FTL_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0);</code>. The result contains the columns <code>SCHEMA</code> (the schema name), <code>TABLE</code> (the table name), <code>COLUMNS</code> (an array of column names), and <code>KEYS</code> (an array of objects). To join a table, use a join as in\: <code>SELECT T.* FROM FTL_SEARCH_DATA('Hello', 0, 0) FT, TEST T WHERE FT.TABLE\='TEST' AND T.ID\=FT.KEYS[0];</code> 
tutorial_1317_p=\ You can also call the index from within a Java application\: 
tutorial_1318_p=\ The Lucene fulltext search supports searching in specific column only. Column names must be uppercase (except if the original columns are double quoted). For column names starting with an underscore (_), another underscore needs to be added. Example\: 
tutorial_1319_p=\ The Lucene fulltext search implementation is not synchronized internally. If you update the database and query the fulltext search concurrently (directly using the Java API of H2 or Lucene itself), you need to ensure operations are properly synchronized. If this is not the case, you may get exceptions such as <code>org.apache.lucene.store.AlreadyClosedException\: this IndexReader is closed</code>. 
tutorial_1320_h2=User-Defined Variables
tutorial_1321_p=\ This database supports user-defined variables. Variables start with <code>@</code> and can be used wherever expressions or parameters are allowed. Variables are not persisted and session scoped, that means only visible from within the session in which they are defined. A value is usually assigned using the SET command\: 
tutorial_1322_p=\ The value can also be changed using the SET() method. This is useful in queries\: 
tutorial_1323_p=\ Variables that are not set evaluate to <code>NULL</code>. The data type of a user-defined variable is the data type of the value assigned to it, that means it is not necessary (or possible) to declare variable names before using them. There are no restrictions on the assigned values; large objects (LOBs) are supported as well. Rolling back a transaction does not affect the value of a user-defined variable. 
tutorial_1324_h2=Date and Time
tutorial_1325_p=\ Date, time and timestamp values support ISO 8601 formatting, including time zone\: 
tutorial_1326_p=\ If the time zone is not set, the value is parsed using the current time zone setting of the system. Date and time information is stored in H2 database files without time zone information. If the database is opened using another system time zone, the date and time will be the same. That means if you store the value '2000-01-01 12\:00\:00' in one time zone, then close the database and open the database again in a different time zone, you will also get '2000-01-01 12\:00\:00'. Please note that changing the time zone after the H2 driver is loaded is not supported. 
tutorial_1327_h2=Using Spring
tutorial_1328_h3=Using the TCP Server
tutorial_1329_p=\ Use the following configuration to start and stop the H2 TCP server using the Spring Framework\: 
tutorial_1330_p=\ The <code>destroy-method</code> will help prevent exceptions on hot-redeployment or when restarting the server. 
tutorial_1331_h3=Error Code Incompatibility
tutorial_1332_p=\ There is an incompatibility with the Spring JdbcTemplate and H2 version 1.3.154 and newer, because of a change in the error code. This will cause the JdbcTemplate to not detect a duplicate key condition, and so a <code>DataIntegrityViolationException</code> is thrown instead of <code>DuplicateKeyException</code>. See also <a href\="https\://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-8235">the issue SPR-8235</a>. The workaround is to add the following XML file to the root of the classpath\: 
tutorial_1333_h2=OSGi
tutorial_1334_p=\ The standard H2 jar can be dropped in as a bundle in an OSGi container. H2 implements the JDBC Service defined in OSGi Service Platform Release 4 Version 4.2 Enterprise Specification. The H2 Data Source Factory service is registered with the following properties\: <code>OSGI_JDBC_DRIVER_CLASS\=org.h2.Driver</code> and <code>OSGI_JDBC_DRIVER_NAME\=H2</code>. The <code>OSGI_JDBC_DRIVER_VERSION</code> property reflects the version of the driver as is. 
tutorial_1335_p=\ The following standard configuration properties are supported\: <code>JDBC_USER, JDBC_PASSWORD, JDBC_DESCRIPTION, JDBC_DATASOURCE_NAME, JDBC_NETWORK_PROTOCOL, JDBC_URL, JDBC_SERVER_NAME, JDBC_PORT_NUMBER</code>. Any other standard property will be rejected. Non-standard properties will be passed on to H2 in the connection URL. 
tutorial_1336_h2=Java Management Extension (JMX)
tutorial_1337_p=\ Management over JMX is supported, but not enabled by default. To enable JMX, append <code>;JMX\=TRUE</code> to the database URL when opening the database. Various tools support JMX, one such tool is the <code>jconsole</code>. When opening the <code>jconsole</code>, connect to the process where the database is open (when using the server mode, you need to connect to the server process). Then go to the <code>MBeans</code> section. Under <code>org.h2</code> you will find one entry per database. The object name of the entry is the database short name, plus the path (each colon is replaced with an underscore character). 
tutorial_1338_p=\ The following attributes and operations are supported\: 
tutorial_1339_code=CacheSize
tutorial_1340_li=\: the cache size currently in use in KB. 
tutorial_1341_code=CacheSizeMax
tutorial_1342_li=\ (read/write)\: the maximum cache size in KB.

tutorial_1368_li=\: list the database settings. 
tutorial_1369_code=listSessions
tutorial_1370_li=\: list the open sessions, including currently executing statement (if any) and locked tables (if any). 
tutorial_1371_p=\ To enable JMX, you may need to set the system properties <code>com.sun.management.jmxremote</code> and <code>com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</code> as required by the JVM.
