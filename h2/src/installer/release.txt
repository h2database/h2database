# Checklist for a release

## Formatting, Spellchecking, Javadocs

    git pull

Do this until there are no errors.
Fix typos, add new words to dictionary.txt:

    ./build.sh spellcheck

Add documentation for all public methods. Make methods private if possible:

    ./build.sh javadocImpl

Ensure lines are not overly long:

    ./build.sh docs

## JDBC Client Jar File Size Verification

The JDBC client is supposed to not have dependencies to the database engine.
To verify, run

    ./build.sh clean jarClient

If this fails with eg. "Expected file size 400 - 500 KB, got: 1687", then
find out where the dependency is, and resolve. As follows:
start by renaming Database to Database2:

    mv src/main/org/h2/engine/Database.java src/main/org/h2/engine/Database2.java
    ./build.sh clean jarClient

This will fail, the first error is for example can not compile Session because Database was not found.
So rename Session to Session2 and try again.
This will fail again, the first error is different, now for example can not compile ResultInterface
because Session was not found. Now, ResultInterface should not depend on the Session.
So this needs to be fixed (the JDBC API shouldn't indirectly depend on it).
After everything is resolved, rename the classes back.

## MVStore Jar File Size Verification

To ensure the MVStore jar file is not too large
(does not reference the database code by accident).
The file size should be about 200 KB:

    ./build.sh jarMVStore

## Changing Version Numbers

Update org.h2.engine.Constants.java:
    if the last build was stable (the normal case):
        set BUILD_DATE_STABLE to current BUILD_DATE
        set BUILD_ID_STABLE to current BUILD_ID
    change the version and build number:
        set BUILD_DATE to today
        increment BUILD_ID

Update changelog.html:
    * create a new "Next Version (unreleased)" with an empty list
    * add a new version
    * remove change log entries of the oldest version (keeping about 500 lines)

Update newsfeed.sql:
    * add new version, for example:
    * (146, '1.4.197', '2017-06-10'),
    * remove oldest entry in that list

## Skipped

The following can be skipped currently, as sourceError.html and source.html
are no longer working (they can be removed, or fixed):
* Minor version change: change sourceError.html and source.html
* If a beta, change download.html: Version ${version} (${versionDate}), Beta
* If a beta, change mainWeb.html: Version ${version} (${versionDate}), Beta

The following can be skipped currently; benchmarks should probably be removed:
* To update benchmark data: use latest versions of other dbs, change version(s) in performance.html
