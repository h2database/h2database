","
Selects data from a table or multiple tables.

Command is executed in the following logical order:

1. Data is taken from table value expressions that are specified in the FROM clause, joins are executed.
If FROM clause is not specified a single row is constructed.

2. WHERE filters rows. Aggregate or window functions are not allowed in this clause.

3. GROUP BY groups the result by the given expression(s).
If GROUP BY clause is not specified, but non-window aggregate functions are used or HAVING is specified
all rows are grouped together.

4. Aggregate functions are evaluated.

5. HAVING filters rows after grouping and evaluation of aggregate functions.
Non-window aggregate functions are allowed in this clause.

6. Window functions are evaluated.

7. QUALIFY filters rows after evaluation of window functions.
Aggregate and window functions are allowed in this clause.

8. DISTINCT removes duplicates.
If DISTINCT ON is used only the specified expressions are checked for duplicates;
ORDER BY clause, if any, is used to determine preserved rows.
First row is each DISTINCT ON group is preserved.
In absence of ORDER BY preserved rows are not determined, database may choose any row from each DISTINCT ON group.

9. UNION, EXCEPT, and INTERSECT combine the result of this query with the results of another query.
INTERSECT has higher precedence than UNION and EXCEPT.
Operators with equal precedence are evaluated from left to right.

10. ORDER BY sorts the result by the given column(s) or expression(s).

11. Number of rows in output can be limited with OFFSET and FETCH clauses.
OFFSET specifies how many rows to skip.
Please note that queries with high offset values can be slow.
FETCH FIRST/NEXT limits the number of rows returned by the query.
If PERCENT is specified number of rows is specified as a percent of the total number of rows
and should be an integer value between 0 and 100 inclusive.
WITH TIES can be used only together with ORDER BY and means that all additional rows that have the same sorting position
as the last row will be also returned.

WINDOW clause specifies window definitions for window functions and window aggregate functions.
This clause can be used to reuse the same definition in multiple functions.

If FOR UPDATE is specified, the tables or rows are locked for writing.
This clause is not allowed in DISTINCT queries and in queries with non-window aggregates, GROUP BY, or HAVING clauses.
Only the selected rows are locked as in an UPDATE statement.
Rows from the right side of a left join and from the left side of a right join, including nested joins, aren't locked.
Locking behavior for rows that were excluded from result using OFFSET / FETCH / LIMIT / TOP or QUALIFY is undefined,
to avoid possible locking of excessive rows try to filter out unneeded rows with the WHERE criteria when possible.
Rows are processed one by one. Each row is read, tested with WHERE criteria, locked, read again and re-tested,
because its value may be changed by concurrent transaction before lock acquisition.
Note that new uncommitted rows from other transactions are not visible unless read uncommitted isolation level is used
and therefore cannot be selected and locked.
Modified uncommitted rows from other transactions that satisfy the WHERE criteria cause this SELECT to wait for
commit or rollback of those transactions.

","
Runs a SQL script from a file. The script is a text file containing SQL
statements; each statement must end with ';'. This command can be used to
restore a database from a backup. The password must be in single quotes; it is
case sensitive and can contain spaces.

Instead of a file name, a URL may be used.
To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix 'classpath:'.
See the [Pluggable File System](https://h2database.com/html/advanced.html#file_system) section.

The compression algorithm must match the one used when creating the script.
Instead of a file, a URL may be used.

If ""QUIRKS_MODE"" is specified, the various compatibility quirks for scripts from older versions of H2 are enabled.
Use this clause when you import script that was generated by H2 1.4.200 or an older version into more recent version.

If ""VARIABLE_BINARY"" is specified, the ""BINARY"" data type will be parsed as ""VARBINARY"".
Use this clause when you import script that was generated by H2 1.4.200 or an older version into more recent version.

If ""FROM_1X"" is specified, quirks for scripts exported from H2 1.*.* are enabled.
Use this flag to populate a new database with the data exported from 1.*.* versions of H2.
This flag also enables ""QUIRKS_MODE"" and ""VARIABLE_BINARY"" implicitly.

Admin rights are required to execute this command.

","
Creates a SQL script from the database.

NODATA will not emit INSERT statements.
SIMPLE does not use multi-row insert statements.
COLUMNS includes column name lists into insert statements.
If the DROP option is specified, drop statements are created for tables, views,
and sequences. If the block size is set, CLOB and BLOB values larger than this
size are split into separate blocks.
BLOCKSIZE is used when writing out LOB data, and specifies the point at the
values transition from being inserted as inline values, to be inserted using
out-of-line commands.
NOSETTINGS turns off dumping the database settings (the SET XXX commands)

If no 'TO fileName' clause is specified, the
script is returned as a result set. This command can be used to create a backup
of the database. For long term storage, it is more portable than copying the
database files.

If a 'TO fileName' clause is specified, then the whole
script (including insert statements) is written to this file, and a result set
without the insert statements is returned.

The password must be in single quotes; it is case sensitive and can contain spaces.

This command locks objects while it is running.
Admin rights are required to execute this command.

When using the TABLE or SCHEMA option, only the selected table(s) / schema(s) are included.

Changes the data type of a column, rename a column,
change the identity value, or change the selectivity.

Changing the data type fails if the data can not be converted.

SET GENERATED ALWAYS, SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT, or identity options convert the column into identity column
(if it wasn't an identity column) and set new values of specified options for its sequence.

DROP IDENTITY removes identity status of a column.

SELECTIVITY sets the selectivity (1-100) for a column.
Setting the selectivity to 0 means the default value.
Selectivity is used by the cost based optimizer to calculate the estimated cost of an index.
Selectivity 100 means values are unique, 10 means every distinct value appears 10 times on average.

SET DEFAULT changes the default value of a column.
This command doesn't affect generated and identity columns.

DROP DEFAULT removes the default value of a column.

DROP EXPRESSION converts generated column into base column.

SET ON UPDATE changes the value that is set on update if value for this column is not specified in update statement.
This command doesn't affect generated and identity columns.

DROP ON UPDATE removes the value that is set on update of a column.

SET DEFAULT ON NULL makes NULL value work as DEFAULT value is assignments to this column.

DROP DEFAULT ON NULL makes NULL value work as NULL value in assignments to this column.

SET NOT NULL sets a column to not allow NULL. Rows may not contain NULL in this column.

DROP NOT NULL and SET NULL set a column to allow NULL.
The column may not be part of a primary key and may not be an identity column.

SET DATA TYPE changes the data type of a column, for each row old value is converted to this data type
unless USING is specified with a custom expression.
USING expression may reference previous value of the modified column by its name and values of other columns.

SET INVISIBLE makes the column hidden, i.e. it will not appear in SELECT * results.
SET VISIBLE has the reverse effect.

","
Creates a new function alias. If this is a ResultSet returning function,
by default the return value is cached in a local temporary file.

DETERMINISTIC - Deterministic functions must always return the same value for the same parameters.

The method name must be the full qualified class and method name,
and may optionally include the parameter classes as in
""java.lang.Integer.parseInt(java.lang.String, int)"". The class and the method
must both be public, and the method must be static. The class must be available
in the classpath of the database engine (when using the server mode,
it must be in the classpath of the server).

When defining a function alias with source code, the Sun ""javac"" is compiler
is used if the file ""tools.jar"" is in the classpath. If not, ""javac"" is run as a separate process.
Only the source code is stored in the database; the class is compiled each time
the database is re-opened. Source code is usually passed
as dollar quoted text to avoid escaping problems. If import statements are used,
then the tag @CODE must be added before the method.

If the method throws an SQLException, it is directly re-thrown to the calling application;
all other exceptions are first converted to a SQLException.

If the first parameter of the Java function is a ""java.sql.Connection"", then a
connection to the database is provided. This connection must not be closed.
If the class contains multiple methods with the given name but different
parameter count, all methods are mapped.

","
Creates a table link to an external table. The driver name may be empty if the
driver is already loaded. If the schema name is not set, only one table with
that name may exist in the target database.

FORCE - Create the LINKED TABLE even if the remote database/table does not exist.

EMIT UPDATES - Usually, for update statements, the old rows are deleted first and then the new
rows are inserted. It is possible to emit update statements (except on
rollback), however in this case multi-row unique key updates may not always
work. Linked tables to the same database share one connection.

READONLY - is set, the remote table may not be updated. This is enforced by H2.

FETCH_SIZE - the number of rows fetched, a hint with non-negative number of rows to fetch from the external table
at once, may be ignored by the driver of external database. 0 is default and means no hint.
The value is passed to ""java.sql.Statement.setFetchSize()"" method.

AUTOCOMMIT - is set to ON, the auto-commit mode is enable. OFF is disable.
The value is passed to ""java.sql.Connection.setAutoCommit()"" method.

If the connection to the source database is lost, the connection is re-opened
(this is a workaround for MySQL that disconnects after 8 hours of inactivity by default).

If a query is used instead of the original table name, the table is read only.
Queries must be enclosed in parenthesis: ""(SELECT * FROM ORDERS)"".

To use JNDI to get the connection, the driver class must be a
javax.naming.Context (for example ""javax.naming.InitialContext""), and the URL must

Creates a new table.

Cached tables (the default for regular tables) are persistent,
and the number of rows is not limited by the main memory.
Memory tables (the default for temporary tables) are persistent,
but the index data is kept in main memory,
that means memory tables should not get too large.

Temporary tables are deleted when closing or opening a database.
Temporary tables can be global (accessible by all connections)
or local (only accessible by the current connection).
The default for temporary tables is global.
Indexes of temporary tables are kept fully in main memory,
unless the temporary table is created using CREATE CACHED TABLE.

The ENGINE option is only required when custom table implementations are used.
The table engine class must implement the interface ""org.h2.api.TableEngine"".
Any table engine parameters are passed down in the tableEngineParams field of the CreateTableData object.

Either ENGINE, or WITH (table engine params), or both may be specified. If ENGINE is not specified
in CREATE TABLE, then the engine specified by DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE option of database params is used.

Tables with the NOT PERSISTENT modifier are kept fully in memory, and all
rows are lost when the database is closed.

The column definitions are optional if a query is specified.
In that case the column list of the query is used.
If the query is specified its results are inserted into created table unless WITH NO DATA is specified.

","
Creates a new trigger.
Admin rights are required to execute this command.

The trigger class must be public and implement ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
Inner classes are not supported.
The class must be available in the classpath of the database engine
(when using the server mode, it must be in the classpath of the server).

The sourceCodeString must define a single method with no parameters that returns ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
See CREATE ALIAS for requirements regarding the compilation.
Alternatively, javax.script.ScriptEngineManager can be used to create an instance of ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
Currently javascript (included in every JRE) and ruby (with JRuby) are supported.
In that case the source must begin respectively with ""//javascript"" or ""#ruby"".

BEFORE triggers are called after data conversion is made, default values are set,
null and length constraint checks have been made;
but before other constraints have been checked.
If there are multiple triggers, the order in which they are called is undefined.

ROLLBACK can be specified in combination with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Only row based AFTER trigger can be called on ROLLBACK.
Exceptions that occur within such triggers are ignored.
As the operations that occur within a trigger are part of the transaction,
ROLLBACK triggers are only required if an operation communicates outside of the database.

INSTEAD OF triggers are implicitly row based and behave like BEFORE triggers.
Only the first such trigger is called. Such triggers on views are supported.
They can be used to make views updatable.
These triggers on INSERT and UPDATE must update the passed new row to values that were actually inserted
by the trigger; they are used for [FINAL TABLE](https://h2database.com/html/grammar.html#data_change_delta_table)
and for retrieval of generated keys.

A BEFORE SELECT trigger is fired just before the database engine tries to read from the table.
The trigger can be used to update a table on demand.
The trigger is called with both 'old' and 'new' set to null.

The MERGE statement will call both INSERT and UPDATE triggers.
Not supported are SELECT triggers with the option FOR EACH ROW,
and AFTER SELECT triggers.

Committing or rolling back a transaction within a trigger is not allowed, except for SELECT triggers.

By default a trigger is called once for each statement, without the old and new rows.
FOR EACH ROW triggers are called once for each inserted, updated, or deleted row.

QUEUE is implemented for syntax compatibility with HSQL and has no effect.

The trigger need to be created in the same schema as the table.
The schema name does not need to be specified when creating the trigger.

A character string literal starts and ends with a single quote.
Two single quotes can be used to create a single quote inside a string.
Prefix ""N"" means a national character string literal;
H2 does not distinguish regular and national character string literals in any way, this prefix has no effect in H2.

String literals staring with ""U&"" are Unicode character string literals.
All character string literals in H2 may have Unicode characters,
but Unicode character string literals may contain Unicode escape sequences ""\0000"" or ""\+000000"",
where \ is an escape character, ""0000"" and ""000000"" are Unicode character codes in hexadecimal notation.
Optional ""UESCAPE"" clause may be used to specify another escape character,
with exception for single quote, double quote, plus sign, and hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, and A-F).
By default the backslash is used.
Two escape characters can be used to include a single character inside a string.
Two single quotes can be used to create a single quote inside a string.

The generated column has a generated column expression.
The generated column expression is evaluated and assigned whenever the row changes.
This expression may reference base columns of the table, but may not reference other data.
The value of the generated column cannot be set explicitly.
Generated columns may not have DEFAULT or ON UPDATE expressions.

On update column expression is used if row is updated,
at least one column has a new value that is different from its previous value
and value for this column is not set explicitly in update statement.

Identity column is a column generated with a sequence.
The column declared as the identity column with IDENTITY data type or with IDENTITY () clause

Referential constraint requires values that exist in other column(s) (usually in another table).

Check constraint requires a specified condition to return TRUE or UNKNOWN (NULL).
It can reference columns of the table, and can reference objects that exist while the statement is executed.
Conditions are only checked when a row is added or modified in the table where the constraint exists.

Optional parameters for CSVREAD and CSVWRITE.
Instead of setting the options one by one, all options can be
combined into a space separated key-value pairs, as follows:
""STRINGDECODE('charset=UTF-8 escape=\"" fieldDelimiter=\"" fieldSeparator=, ' ||""
""'lineComment=# lineSeparator=\n null= rowSeparator=')"".
The following options are supported:

""caseSensitiveColumnNames"" (true or false; disabled by default),

""charset"" (for example 'UTF-8'),

""escape"" (the character that escapes the field delimiter),

""fieldDelimiter"" (a double quote by default),

""fieldSeparator"" (a comma by default),

""lineComment"" (disabled by default),

""lineSeparator"" (the line separator used for writing; ignored for reading),

""null"", Support reading existing CSV files that contain explicit ""null"" delimiters.
Note that an empty, unquoted values are also treated as null.

""preserveWhitespace"" (true or false; disabled by default),

""writeColumnHeader"" (true or false; enabled by default).

For a newline or other special character, use STRINGDECODE as in the example above.
A space needs to be escaped with a backslash (""'\ '""), and
a backslash needs to be escaped with another backslash (""'\\'"").
All other characters are not to be escaped, that means
newline and tab characters are written as such.

Two double quotes can be used to create a single double quote inside an identifier.
With default settings identifiers in H2 are case sensitive.

Identifiers staring with ""U&"" are Unicode identifiers.
All identifiers in H2 may have Unicode characters,
but Unicode identifiers may contain Unicode escape sequences ""\0000"" or ""\+000000"",
where \ is an escape character, ""0000"" and ""000000"" are Unicode character codes in hexadecimal notation.
Optional ""UESCAPE"" clause may be used to specify another escape character,
with exception for single quote, double quote, plus sign, and hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, and A-F).
By default the backslash is used.

the default window frame depends on window order clause.
If window order clause is also not specified
the default window frame contains all the rows in the partition.
If window order clause is specified
the default window frame contains all preceding rows and all rows from the current group.

Window frame unit determines how rows or groups of rows are selected and counted.
If ROWS is specified rows are not grouped in any way and relative numbers of rows are used in bounds.
If RANGE is specified rows are grouped according window order clause,
preceding and following values mean the difference between value in the current row and in the target rows,

If GROUPS is specified rows are grouped according window order clause,
preceding and following values means relative number of groups of rows,
and CURRENT ROW in bound specification means current group of rows.

This type allows storing serialized Java objects. Internally, a byte array with serialized form is used.
The allowed length is from 1 (useful only with custom serializer) to 1048576 bytes.
The length is a size constraint; only the actual data is persisted.

Serialization and deserialization is done on the client side only with two exclusions described below.
Deserialization is only done when ""getObject"" is called.
Java operations cannot be executed inside the database engine for security reasons.
Use ""PreparedStatement.setObject"" with ""Types.JAVA_OBJECT"" or ""H2Type.JAVA_OBJECT""
as a third argument to store values.

If Java method alias has ""Object"" parameter(s), values are deserialized during invocation of this method
on the server side.

"Functions (Table)","CSVREAD","
@h2@ CSVREAD(fileNameString [, columnsString [, csvOptions ] ] )
","
Returns the result set of reading the CSV (comma separated values) file.
For each parameter, NULL means the default value should be used.

If the column names are specified (a list of column names separated with the
fieldSeparator), those are used, otherwise (or if they are set to NULL) the first line of
the file is interpreted as the column names.
In that case, column names that contain no special characters (only letters, '_',
and digits; similar to the rule for Java identifiers) are processed is the same way as unquoted identifiers
and therefore case of characters may be changed.
Other column names are processed as quoted identifiers and case of characters is preserved.
To preserve the case of column names unconditionally use
[caseSensitiveColumnNames](https://h2database.com/html/grammar.html#csv_options) option.

The default charset is the default value for this system, and the default field separator
is a comma. Missing unquoted values as well as data that matches nullString is
parsed as NULL. All columns are of type VARCHAR.

The BOM (the byte-order-mark) character 0xfeff at the beginning of the file is ignored.

This function can be used like a table: ""SELECT * FROM CSVREAD(...)"".

Instead of a file, a URL may be used, for example
""jar:file:///c:/temp/example.zip!/org/example/nested.csv"".
To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix ""classpath:"".
To read from HTTP, use the prefix ""http:"" (as in a browser).

For performance reason, CSVREAD should not be used inside a join.
Instead, import the data first (possibly into a temporary table) and then use the table.

Admin rights are required to execute this command.

RANK() OVER windowNameOrSpecification
","
Returns the rank of the current row.
The rank of a row is the number of rows that precede this row plus 1.
If two or more rows have the same values in ORDER BY columns, these rows get the same rank from the first row with the same values.
It means that gaps in ranks are possible.
This function requires window order clause.
Window frame clause is not allowed for this function.
